	abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a very common, non-invasive diagnostic procedure and its interpretation is increasingly supported by algorithms. The progress in the field of automatic ECG analysis has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first benchmarking results for the recently published, freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG dataset PTB-XL, covering a variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks to age and sex prediction. Among the investigated deep-learning-based timeseries classification algorithms, we find that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance across all tasks. We find consistent results on the ICBEB2018 challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. These benchmarking results are complemented by deeper insights into the classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis, which provide connecting points for future research on the dataset. Our results emphasize the prospects of deep-learning-based algorithms in the field of ECG analysis, not only in terms of quantitative accuracy but also in terms of clinically equally important further quality metrics such as uncertainty quantification and interpretability. With this resource, we aim to establish the PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG analysis algorithms and encourage other researchers in the field to join these efforts.},

	abstract = {Cardiac arrest (CA) may cause severe brain damage, cognitive impairments and death. Monitoring neurological recovery after hospitalization is critical to provide suitable treatment. In this study, we aim to develop an algorithm to aid in neurological recovery classification. The dataset used for this purpose includes 1020 patients and contains both continuous sensor measurements, taken from 0 to 72 hours after the CA, and structured data. More specifically the dataset is split into a training set (60\%), validation set (10\%) and undisclosed test set (30\%). The developed model uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to extract features from 5-minute time series segments, fed into a recurrent neural network, to capture temporal information and provide adaptability in recording length. The output features are then merged with embedded patient metadata in a fully connected layer, for the final classification of neurological outcome. The project is part of the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023, where our team (EEG-Attackers) achieved a challenge score and rank on the undisclosed test dataset of 0.16 (30), 0.13 (33), 0.11 (34) and 0.12 (35) using recordings from the first 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after CA.},

	abstract = {Medical data such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) has received an increased interest within biometric settings. One of the main benefits is the difficulty in counterfeiting the information due to its hidden nature. However, medical information may be exposed to intra-subject variability. This is evident in extraction of soft biometric traits from ECG, where results can vary widely depending on cardiac condition and status. This work investigates methods of lowering the variability, by employing multi-task learning on a shared feature extractor. Three different architectures are suggested and benchmarked. Specifically, experiments are carried out on age and gender estimation showing state of the art results on two public ECG datasets, while lowering estimation variance among instances.},

support systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the

of such algorithms requires large training datasets and clear benchmark
procedures. In our opinion, both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by
existing freely accessible ECG datasets.

The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21837 clinical 12-lead ECGs from
18885 patients of 10 second length. The raw waveform data was annotated by up
to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each
record. The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG
standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements. To ensure
comparability of machine learning algorithms trained on the dataset, we
provide recommended splits into training and test sets. In combination with
the extensive annotation, this turns the dataset into a rich resource for the
training and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. The
dataset is complemented by extensive metadata on demographics, infarction
characteristics, likelihoods for diagnostic ECG statements as well as
annotated signal properties.},

We developed and validated a deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DLA) for detecting MI using 6-lead ECG. A total of 412,461 ECGs were used to develop a variational autoencoder (VAE) that reconstructed precordial 6-lead ECG using limb 6-lead ECG. Data from 9536, 1301, and 1768 ECGs of adult patients who underwent coronary angiography within 24 h from each ECG were used for development, internal and external validation, respectively. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLA with VAE using a 6-lead ECG were 0.880 and 0.854, respectively, and the performances were preserved by the territory of the coronary lesion. Our DLA successfully detected MI using a 12-lead ECG or a 6-lead ECG. The results indicate that MI could be detected not only with a conventional 12 lead ECG but also with a life type 6-lead ECG device that employs our DLA.},

Using 7,313 consecutive patients from multiple clinical sites, we derived and externally validated an intelligent model that outperformed practicing clinicians and other widely used commercial interpretation systems, substantially boosting both precision and sensitivity. Our derived OMI risk score provided enhanced rule-in and rule-out accuracy relevant to routine care, and, when combined with the clinical judgment of trained emergency personnel, it helped correctly reclassify one in three patients with chest pain.

	abstract = {Chest radiography (CXR) is the most frequently performed radiological test worldwide because of its wide availability, non-invasive nature, and low cost. The ability of CXR to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, give insight into cardiac function, and predict cardiovascular events is often underutilized, not clearly understood, and affected by inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore, more sophisticated tests are generally needed to assess cardiovascular diseases. Considering the sustained increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, it is critical to find accessible, fast, and reproducible tests to help diagnose these frequent conditions. The expanded focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to diagnostic cardiovascular imaging has also been applied to CXR, with several publications suggesting that AI models can be trained to detect cardiovascular conditions by identifying features in the CXR. Multiple models have been developed to predict mortality, cardiovascular morphology and function, coronary artery disease, valvular heart diseases, aortic diseases, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. The available evidence demonstrates that the use of AI-based tools applied to CXR for the diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions and prognostication has the potential to transform clinical care. AI-analyzed CXRs could be utilized in the future as a complimentary, easy-to-apply technology to improve diagnosis and risk stratification for cardiovascular diseases. Such advances will likely help better target more advanced investigations, which may reduce the burden of testing in some cases, as well as better identify higher-risk patients who would benefit from earlier, dedicated, and comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and D-dimer levels are used to screen potential cases.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep learning model (DLM) to detect PE using ECGs and investigate the clinical value of false detections in patients without PE.
METHODS: Among patients who visited the emergency department between 2011 and 2019, PE cases were identified through a review of medical records. Non-PE ECGs were collected from patients without a diagnostic code for PE. There were 113 PE and 51,456 non-PE ECGs in the training and validation sets for developing the DLM, respectively, and 27 PE and 13,105 non-PE cases in an independent testing set for performance validation. A human-machine competition was conducted from the testing set to compare the performance of the DLM with that of physicians. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity were used to determine the diagnostic value. Survival analysis was used to assess the prognosis of the patients without PE, stratified by DLM prediction.
RESULTS: The DLM was as effective as physicians in diagnosing PE, with 70.8\% sensitivity and 69.7\% specificity. The area under the ROC curve of DLM was 0.778 in the testing set and up to 0.9 with D-dimer and demographic data. The non-PE patients whose ECG was misclassified as PE by DLM had higher all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.13 (1.51-3.02)] and risk of non-cardiovascular hospitalization [HR 1.55 (1.42-1.68)] than those correctly classified.
CONCLUSIONS: A DLM-enhanced ECG system may prompt PE recognition and provide prognostic outcomes in patients with false-positive predictions.},

This study aimed to develop and validate deep-learning-based risk stratification for the mortality of patients with AMI (DAMI). Methods The data of 22,875 AMI patients from the Korean working group of the myocardial infarction (KorMI) registry were exclusively divided into 12,152 derivation data of 36 hospitals and 10,723 validation data of 23 hospitals. The predictor variables were the initial demographic and laboratory data. The endpoints were in-hospital mortality and 12-months mortality. We compared the DAMI performance with the global registry of acute coronary event (GRACE) score, acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network (ACTION) score, and the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score using the validation data. Results In-hospital mortality for the study subjects was 4.4\% and 6-month mortality after survival upon discharge was 2.2\%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DAMI were 0.905 [95\% confidence interval 0.902–0.909] and 0.870 [0.865–0.876] for the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients, respectively; these results significantly outperformed those of the GRACE (0.851 [0.846–0.856], 0.810 [0.803–0.819]), ACTION (0.852 [0.847–0.857], 0.806 [0.799–0.814] and TIMI score (0.781 [0.775–0.787], 0.593[0.585–0.603]). DAMI predicted 30.9\% of patients more accurately than the GRACE score. As secondary outcome, during the 6-month follow-up, the high risk group, defined by the DAMI, has a significantly higher mortality rate than the low risk group (17.1\% vs. 0.5\%, p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, such as the recovery of ST elevation, are associated with prognosis, but quantifying them is challenging. Deep-learning algorithms (DLA) can diagnose STEMI and quantify the probability as a bio-index. However, the prognostic value of this index has yet to be well studied.This study aims to investigate the feasibility of predicting the prognosis of patients with STEMI by analyzing serial ECGs post-primary PCI using an DLA designed to detect AMI and STEMI.We developed a DLA to detect acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and STEMI using 12-lead ECGs from hospital A. The DLA was based on convolutional neural network and presented the index for probability of AMI and STEMI as a number between 0 and 1. We subsequently analyzed serial ECGs from hospital B, taken more than one month prior to the STEMI event (baseline), at pre-PCI (at emergency department [ED]), immediate post-PCI, 6h, 24h, 1 month after PCI, using the DLA. The primary endpoint was a post-STEMI heart failure defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50\%.A total of 22,259 ECGs (13,916 ECGs of non-AMI and 8,343 ECGs of AMI) from 15,113 patients were used to develop and validate the DLA. The area under the curve (AUC) of the final DLA was 0.950 for AMI and 0.954 for STEMI. Serial ECGs of 639 STEMI patients were analyzed. The mean index value at different time points were as follows: 0.061 ± 0.158 in baseline ECG, 0.801 ± 0.333 in ECG at ED, 0.525 ± 0.429 in immediate post-PCI, 0.467 ± 0.425 in 6-hour, 0.482 ± 0.423 in 24-hour, and 0.273 ± 0.348 in 1-month after PCI (ANOVA P-value \&lt;0.001). To evaluate the predictive value of the DLA index, we stratified the study population into low, intermediate, and high-risk group based on the DLA index, with thresholds of 0.03 and 0.45 of the immediate post-PCI AI indices. The mean LVEF was 53.0 ± 10.1\% in the low-risk group, 49.6 ± 10 \%, and 47.4 ± 10.2 \% in the intermediate and the high-risk group (ANOVA P-value \&lt; 0.001). The prevalence of post-STEMI heart failure was 30.6\%, 46.4\%, and 60.6\%, respectively (P \&lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the DLA index was significantly associated with the recovery of left ventricular function. The prevalence of heart failure in 3-month follow-up echocardiography was highest in the high-risk group (15.4\% vs. 27.1\% vs. 31.8\%, respectively, P = 0.022).Our study shows that the DLA-derived bio-index is an effective tool to quantify ECG changes after primary PCI in STEMI patients and predict post-AMI heart failure. The DLA index is also associated with left ventricular function recovery, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker. Further studies are needed to validate our results and explore the use of the DLA index in assessing myocardial reperfusion after primary PCI.},

An artificial intelligence (AI)-based triage algorithm (DELTAnet), able to support physicians in ECG prioritization, could help reduce current logistic burden of overreading ECGs and improve time to treatment for acute and life-threatening disorders. However, the effect of clinical implementation of such AI algorithms is rarely investigated.Adult patients at non-cardiology departments who underwent ECG testing as a part of routine clinical care were included in this prospective cohort study. DELTAnet was used to classify 12-lead ECGs into one of the following triage classes: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Performance was compared with triage classes based on the final clinical diagnosis. Moreover, the associations between predicted classes and clinical outcomes were investigated. A total of 1061 patients and ECGs were included. Performance was good with a mean concordance statistic of 0.96 (95\% confidence interval 0.95–0.97) when comparing DELTAnet with the clinical triage classes. Moreover, zero ECGs that required a change in policy or referral to the cardiologist were missed and there was a limited number of cases predicted as acute that did not require follow-up (2.6\%).This study is the first to prospectively investigate the impact of clinical implementation of an ECG-based AI triage algorithm. It shows that DELTAnet is efficacious and safe to be used in clinical practice for triage of 12-lead ECGs in non-cardiology hospital departments.},

We aimed to develop deep-learning models (DLMs) with electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray (CXR) features to detect AD and evaluate their performance.
METHODS: This study included 43,473 patients in the emergency department (ED) between July 2012 and December 2019 for retrospective DLM development. A development cohort including 49,071 ED records (120 AD type A and 64 AD type B) was used to train DLMs for ECG and CXR, and 9904 independent ED records (40 AD type A and 34 AD type B) were used to validate DLM performance. Human-machine competitions of ECG and CXR were conducted. Patient characteristics and laboratory results were used to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. The DLM-enabled AD diagnostic process was prospectively evaluated in 25,885 ED visits.
RESULTS: The area under the curves (AUCs) of the ECG and CXR models were 0.918 and 0.857 for detecting AD in a human-machine competition, respectively, which were better than those of the participating physicians. In the validation cohort, the AUCs of the integrated model were 0.882, 0.960, and 0.813 in all AD, AD type A, and AD type B patients, respectively, with a sensitivity of 100.0\% and a specificity of 81.7\% for AD type A. In patients with chest pain and D-dimer tests, the DLM could predict more precisely, achieving a positive predictive value of 62.5\% in the prospective evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: DLMs may serve as decision-supporting tools for identification of AD and facilitate differential diagnosis in patients with acute chest pain.},

	abstract = {Background

The early diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and D-dimer levels are used to screen potential cases.


Objective

To develop a deep learning model (DLM) to detect PE using ECGs and investigate the clinical value of false detections in patients without PE.


Methods

Among patients who visited the emergency department between 2011 and 2019, PE cases were identified through a review of medical records. Non-PE ECGs were collected from patients without a diagnostic code for PE. There were 113 PE and 51,456 non-PE ECGs in the training and validation sets for developing the DLM, respectively, and 27 PE and 13,105 non-PE cases in an independent testing set for performance validation. A human-machine competition was conducted from the testing set to compare the performance of the DLM with that of physicians. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity were used to determine the diagnostic value. Survival analysis was used to assess the prognosis of the patients without PE, stratified by DLM prediction.


Results

The DLM was as effective as physicians in diagnosing PE, with 70.8\% sensitivity and 69.7\% specificity. The area under the ROC curve of DLM was 0.778 in the testing set and up to 0.9 with D-dimer and demographic data. The non-PE patients whose ECG was misclassified as PE by DLM had higher all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.13 (1.51-3.02)] and risk of non-cardiovascular hospitalization [HR 1.55 (1.42-1.68)] than those correctly classified.


Conclusions

A DLM-enhanced ECG system may prompt PE recognition and provide prognostic outcomes in patients with false-positive predictions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop the International Cardiac Arrest Research (I-CARE), a harmonized multicenter clinical and electroencephalography database for acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury research involving patients with cardiac arrest.
DESIGN: Multicenter cohort, partly prospective and partly retrospective.
SETTING: Seven academic or teaching hospitals from the United States and Europe.
PATIENTS: Individuals 16 years old or older who were comatose after return of spontaneous circulation following a cardiac arrest who had continuous electroencephalography monitoring were included.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and electroencephalography data were harmonized and stored in a common Waveform Database-compatible format. Automated spike frequency, background continuity, and artifact detection on electroencephalography were calculated with 10-second resolution and summarized hourly. Neurologic outcome was determined at 3-6 months using the best Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale. This database includes clinical data and 56,676 hours (3.9 terabytes) of continuous electroencephalography data for 1,020 patients. Most patients died (n = 603, 59\%), 48 (5\%) had severe neurologic disability (CPC 3 or 4), and 369 (36\%) had good functional recovery (CPC 1-2). There is significant variability in mean electroencephalography recording duration depending on the neurologic outcome (range, 53-102 hr for CPC 1 and CPC 4, respectively). Epileptiform activity averaging 1 Hz or more in frequency for at least 1 hour was seen in 258 patients (25\%) (19\% for CPC 1-2 and 29\% for CPC 3-5). Burst suppression was observed for at least 1 hour in 207 (56\%) and 635 (97\%) patients with CPC 1-2 and CPC 3-5, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The I-CARE consortium electroencephalography database provides a comprehensive real-world clinical and electroencephalography dataset for neurophysiology research of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. This dataset covers the spectrum of abnormal electroencephalography patterns after cardiac arrest, including epileptiform patterns and those in the ictal-interictal continuum.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
This study sought to determine whether 80-lead body surface potential mapping (BSPM) would improve detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and occluded culprit artery in patients presenting with ST-segment depression (STD) only on 12-lead ECG.

Background:
In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the standard 12-lead ECG has limited sensitivity (50–60\%) for AMI.

Methods:
Consecutive patients presenting pre- and in-hospital between 2000 and 2006 with acute ischaemic-type chest pain and an initial 12-lead ECG with STD only of ≥ 0.05 mV in two or more contiguous leads were analysed. Flow in the culprit artery at angiography was graded using the TIMI flow grade (TFG) criteria.

Results:
Enrolled were 410 patients: of these, 240 (59\%) had an occluded culprit artery (TFG 0/1) with AMI, 80 (19\%) had a patent culprit artery (TFG 2/3) with AMI, 67 (16\%) had TFG 2/3 with cardiac troponin T (cTnT) {\textless}0.03 µg/l, and 23 (6\%) had TFG 0/1 with cTnT {\textless} 0.03 µg/l. BSPM ST-segment elevation (STE) occurred in 267 (65\%) patients. For the diagnosis of TFG 0/1 in the culprit artery and AMI, BSPM STE had sensitivity 91\% and specificity 72\% with STE occurring most commonly in the posterior territory (60\%). Patients with TFG 0/1 and AMI were significantly more likely to suffer death or nonfatal MI at 30 days than those with TFG 2/3 and cTnT {\textless} 0.03 µg/l (adjusted hazard ratio 4.12, 95\% CI 1.67–8.56, p = 0.003).

Conclusion:
Among 410 ACS patients presenting with only STD, BSPM identifies STE beyond the territory of the 12-lead ECG with sensitivity 91\% and specificity 72\% for diagnosis of occluded culprit artery with AMI.},

All human studies of prehospital adult patients suspected of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in which prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation by paramedics or computers was evaluated and reporting all 4 (true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative) values were included. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for the diagnostic accuracy of prehospital ECG interpretation by paramedics (Clinical Question [CQ] 1) and computers (CQ2). After screening, 4 studies for CQ1 and 6 studies for CQ2 were finally included in the meta-analysis. Regarding CQ1, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 82.5–99.0\%) and 95.8\% (95\% CI 82.3–99.1\%), respectively.

	abstract = {Objective:
Most cardiac arrest patients who are successfully resuscitated are initially comatose due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable prognostic information. However, prior approaches largely rely on snapshots of the EEG, without taking advantage of temporal information.

Methods:
We present a recurrent deep neural network with the goal of capturing temporal dynamics from longitudinal EEG data to predict long-term neurological outcomes. We utilized a large international dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 1,038 cardiac arrest patients from seven hospitals in Europe and the US. Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 3–5, and good outcome as CPC score 0–2 at 3 to 6-months after cardiac arrest. Model performance is evaluated using 5-fold cross validation.

Results:
The proposed approach provides predictions which improve over time, beginning from an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.72–0.81) at 12 hours, and reaching 0.88 (95\% CI: 0.85–0.91) by 66 h after cardiac arrest. At 66 h, (sensitivity, specificity) points of interest on the ROC curve for predicting poor outcomes were (32,99)\%, (55,95)\%, and (62,90)\%, (99,23)\%, (95,47)\%, and (90,62)\%; whereas for predicting good outcome, the corresponding operating points were (17,99)\%, (47,95)\%, (62,90)\%, (99,19)\%, (95,48)\%, (70,90)\%. Moreover, the model provides predicted probabilities that closely match the observed frequencies of good and poor outcomes (calibration error 0.04).

Conclusions and Significance:
These findings suggest that accounting for EEG trend information can substantially improve prediction of neurologic outcomes for patients with coma following cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {Outcome prognostication in comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA) remains to date a challenge. The major determinant of clinical outcome is the post-hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. Electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used to assess neural functions in comatose patients. Currently, EEG-based outcome prognosis relies on visual evaluation by medical experts, which is time consuming, prone to subjectivity, and oblivious to complex patterns. The field of deep learning has given rise to powerful algorithms for detecting patterns in large amounts of data. Analyzing EEG signals of coma patients with deep neural networks with the goal of assisting in outcome prognosis is therefore a natural application of these algorithms. Here, we provide the first narrative literature review on the use of deep learning for prognostication after CA. Existing studies show overall high performance in predicting outcome, relying either on spontaneous or on auditory evoked EEG signals. Moreover, the literature is concerned with algorithmic interpretability, and has shown that largely, deep neural networks base their decisions on clinically or neurophysiologically meaningful features. We conclude this review by discussing considerations that the fields of artificial intelligence and neurology will need to jointly address in the future, in order for deep learning algorithms to break the publication barrier, and to be integrated in clinical practice.},

          Visual assessment of the electroencephalogram by experienced clinical neurophysiologists allows reliable outcome prediction of approximately half of all comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Deep neural networks hold promise to achieve similar or even better performance, being more objective and consistent.
          Design: 
          Prospective cohort study.
          Setting: 
          Medical ICU of five teaching hospitals in the Netherlands.
          Patients: 
          Eight-hundred ninety-five consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest.
          Interventions: 
          None.
          Measurements and Main Results: 
          Continuous electroencephalogram was recorded during the first 3 days after cardiac arrest. Functional outcome at 6 months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1–2) or poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3–5). We trained a convolutional neural network, with a VGG architecture (introduced by the Oxford Visual Geometry Group), to predict neurologic outcome at 12 and 24 hours after cardiac arrest using electroencephalogram epochs and outcome labels as inputs. Output of the network was the probability of good outcome. Data from two hospitals were used for training and internal validation (n = 661). Eighty percent of these data was used for training and cross-validation, the remaining 20\% for independent internal validation. Data from the other three hospitals were used for external validation (n = 234). Prediction of poor outcome was most accurate at 12 hours, with a sensitivity in the external validation set of 58\% (95\% CI, 51–65\%) at false positive rate of 0\% (CI, 0–7\%). Good outcome could be predicted at 12 hours with a sensitivity of 48\% (CI, 45–51\%) at a false positive rate of 5\% (CI, 0–15\%) in the external validation set.
          Conclusions: 
          Deep learning of electroencephalogram signals outperforms any previously reported outcome predictor of coma after cardiac arrest, including visual electroencephalogram assessment by trained electroencephalogram experts.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypoxic brain injury is the largest contributor to disability and mortality after cardiac arrest. We aim to identify electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics that can predict outcome on cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).
METHODS: We retrospectively examined clinical, EEG, functional outcome at discharge, and in-hospital mortality for 373 adult subjects with return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3-5. Pure suppression-burst (SB) was defined as SB not associated with status epilepticus (SE), seizures, or generalized periodic discharges.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 68.6\% (N=256). Presence of both unreactive EEG background and SE was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100\% (95\% confidence interval: 0.96-1) and a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0\% (95\% CI: 0-0.11) for poor functional outcome. A prediction model including demographics data, admission exam, presence of status epilepticus, pure SB, and lack of EEG reactivity had an area under the curve of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.87-0.95) for poor functional outcome prediction, and 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.94-0.98) for in-hospital mortality. Presence of pure SB (N=87) was confounded by anesthetics use in 83.9\% of the cases, and was not an independent predictor of poor functional outcome, having a FPR of 23\% (95\% CI: 0.19-0.28).
CONCLUSIONS: An unreactive EEG background and SE predicted poor functional outcome and in-hospital mortality in cardiac arrest patients undergoing TTM. Prognostic value of pure SB is confounded by use of sedative agents, and its use on prognostication decisions should be made with caution.},

DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: General intensive care unit at a university hospital.
PATIENTS: Comatose patients after cardiac arrest and treated with hypothermia.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were sedated and continuously monitored using an amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram. Monitoring was commenced on arrival in the intensive care unit and continued until recovery of consciousness, death, or 120 hrs after cardiac arrest. The amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram was interpreted together with the original electroencephalogram and analyzed without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. The amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram patterns at start of registration and at normothermia and the transitions of the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram patterns over time were correlated to outcome.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 111 consecutive patients were assessed; 11 patients were not included because of technical reasons and five were excluded because of death before normothermia. Ninety-five patients remained; 57 (60\%) eventually regained consciousness, of whom 49 (52\%) lived an independent life at 6 months. Thirty-one patients (33\%) at start of registration and 62 patients (65\%) at normothermia had a continuous electroencephalogram pattern, and this was strongly associated with recovery of consciousness (29/31 [90\%] and 54/62 [87\%]). A suppression-burst pattern was always transient and patients with suppression-burst at any time remained in coma until death. An initial flat pattern was registered in 47 patients, but this had no prognostic value. Electrographic status epilepticus was a common finding (26/95 patients [27\%]) and two types of electrographic status epilepticus were identified: one developed from suppression-burst and one developed from a continuous background. Two patients from the latter group regained consciousness.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram adds valuable early positive and negative prognostic information in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest. We identified two types of postanoxic electrographic status epilepticus, which is a novel finding with possible therapeutic implications.},

	abstract = {Background
To quantitatively summarize the available epidemiological evidence on the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases, and the references of retrieved articles were manually reviewed to identify studies reporting the outcome of OHCA patients who received CPR. The overall incidence and outcome of OHCA were assessed using a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results
A total of 141 eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was 29.7\% (95\% CI 27.6–31.7\%), the rate of survival to hospital admission was 22.0\% (95\% CI 20.7–23.4\%), the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 8.8\% (95\% CI 8.2–9.4\%), the pooled 1-month survival rate was 10.7\% (95\% CI 9.1–13.3\%), and the 1-year survival rate was 7.7\% (95\% CI 5.8–9.5\%). Subgroup analysis showed that survival to hospital discharge was more likely among OHCA patients whose cardiac arrest was witnessed by a bystander or emergency medical services (EMS) (10.5\%; 95\% CI 9.2–11.7\%), who received bystander CPR (11.3\%, 95\% CI 9.3–13.2\%), and who were living in Europe and North America (Europe 11.7\%; 95\% CI 10.5–13.0\%; North America: 7.7\%; 95\% CI 6.9–8.6\%). The survival to discharge (8.6\% in 1976–1999 vs. 9.9\% in 2010–2019), 1-month survival (8.0\% in 2000–2009 vs. 13.3\% in 2010–2019), and 1-year survival (8.0\% in 2000–2009 vs. 13.3\% in 2010–2019) rates of OHCA patients who underwent CPR significantly increased throughout the study period. The Egger’s test did not indicate evidence of publication bias for the outcomes of OHCA patients who underwent CPR.

Conclusions
The global survival rate of OHCA patients who received CPR has increased in the past 40 years. A higher survival rate post-OHCA is more likely among patients who receive bystander CPR and who live in Western countries.

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of global mortality, accounting for almost 17 million deaths annually or 30\% of all global mortality. In developing countries, it causes twice as many deaths as HIV, malaria and TB combined. It is estimated that about 40-50\% of all cardiovascular deaths are sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) and about 80\% of these are caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, about 6 million sudden cardiac deaths occur annually due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The survival rate from sudden cardiac arrest is less than 1\% worldwide and close to 5\% in the US. Prevention of cardiovascular disease by increasing awareness of risk factors such as lack of exercise, inappropriate diet and smoking has reduced cardiovascular mortality in the US over the past few decades. However, there is still a huge cardiovascular disease burden globally as well as in the US. Therefore, there is a need to develop complementary strategies for management of sudden cardiac death. The data from several trials conclusively indicate that implantable defibrillators improve mortality in patients who have experienced an episode or are at high risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmias. These devices are reimbursed and are being used frequently in the developed economies for management of SCD. However, due to that low level of public and private health spending in developing economies and the relatively high cost of ICDs, their implant rates are very low there. The Automatic External Defibrillators and Emergency Medical Response Services equipped with AEDs provide complementary as well as alternative opportunities for management of SCD. There are several challenges associated with the adoption of these strategies. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies need to be compared with ICDs to determine the appropriate strategy for various geographies. The global problem of SCD as well as the various options for its management will be discussed in the presentation.},

This thesis aim to contribute towards two questions concerning safety: "What is the potential safety benefit of autonomous driving?'' and "How can we ensure safe operation of such vehicles?''.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}In the first part of the thesis, methods for evaluating the safety benefit are investigated. In particular predictive effectiveness evaluation based on resimulation of accident data, using models to estimate new outcomes in case the safety system had been available. To illustrate the methodology, four examples of gradual increase in model complexity are presented. First, an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system using a sensor model, decision algorithm, vehicle dynamics model and regression based injury model. This is extended in a Forward Collision Warning (FCW) system which additionally requires a driver model to simulate driver reactions. The third example shows how an active, AEB, and passive, airbag, system can be combined. Finally the fourth example combines several systems to emulate a highly automated vehicle. Apart from predicting the real world performance, this analysis also identifies current safety gaps by studying the residual of the accident set.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Safety benefit estimation using accident data gives an evaluation on the current accident distributions, however, the systems may introduce new accidents if not operated as intended. In the second part of the thesis, safety verification processes with the intent of preventing unsafe operation, are presented. This is particularly challenging for machine learning based components, such as neural networks. In this case, traditional analytical verification approaches are difficult to apply due to the non-linearity and high dimensional parameter spaces. Similarly, statistical safety arguments often require unfeasible amounts of annotated validation data. Instead, monitor functions are investigated as a complement to increase safety during operation. The method presented estimates the similarity of the driving environment, compared to the training data, where decisions inferred from novel data can be considered less reliable. Although not providing a complete safety assurance, the methodology show promising initial results for increasing safety. In addition, it could potentially be used to collect novel data and reduce redundancy in training data.},

The aim of this paper is to increase safety when using neural networks, by proposing a monitoring framework based on novelty estimation of incoming driving data. The idea is to use unsupervised instance discrimination to learn a similarity measure across ego-vehicle camera images. By estimating a von Mises-Fisher distribution of expected ego-camera images they can be compared with unexpected novel images. A novelty measurement is inferred through the likelihood of test frames belonging to the expected distribution. The suggested method provides competitive results to several other novelty or anomaly detection algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It also shows promising results on real world driving scenarios by distinguishing novel driving scenes from the training data of BDD100k. Applied on the identical training-test data split, the method is also able to predict the performance profile of a segmentation network.

	abstract = {It has been proposed that automated vehicles will greatly increase road traffic safety. However, few attempts have been made to quantify this thesis and to compare the expected benefits with more traditional safety systems. This study was carried out in five steps, adding systems in each step (from passive safety, standard Advances Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), advanced ADAS, safety-minded driving, to cautious driving) in order to capture the benefit of increasing levels of automation. Conservative and optimistic rules based on the expected performance of each safety system were developed and applied to the German In-Depth Accident Study database. Adding safety systems was effective in preventing fatalities, ranging from 12-13\% (step 1, passive safety, no automation, conservative-optimistic estimate) to 45-63\% (step 5, cautious driving). The highest automation level, in step 5, achieved a reduction of Vulnerable Road User (VRU) fatalities of 33-41\%. Thus, passive and active safety systems contribute substantially to preventing fatalities and their further development and deployment should not be abandoned. Even the safest foreseeable, highly automated passenger cars are not likely to avoid all crashes and all road traffic fatalities. While increased market penetration across safety systems will make road traffic substantially safer, more efforts are needed to protect VRUs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with and without acute coronary occlusions, and determine if myocardial strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography can identify acute occlusions in patients presenting with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).
METHODS: 111 patients with suspected NSTE-ACS were enrolled shortly after admittance. Echocardiographic measurements were performed a median of 1 h (interquartile range 0.5-4) after admittance, and coronary angiography 36 ± 21 h after onset of symptoms. Territorial longitudinal and circumferential strain was calculated based on the perfusion territories of the three major coronary arteries in a 16-segment model of the left ventricle, and compared with traditional echocardiographic parameters. Long-term follow-up was by echocardiography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI).
RESULTS: Patients with NSTEMI due to acute coronary occlusion had higher peak troponin T than patients with NSTEMI without acute occlusions (4.9 ± 4.7 vs 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/l, p{\textless}0.001), larger infarct size by ceMRI (13 ± 8\% vs 3 ± 3\%, p{\textless}0.001) and poorer left ventricular ejection fraction (48 ± 6\% vs 57 ± 6\%, p{\textless}0.001) at follow-up. Territorial circumferential strain was the best parameter for predicting acute coronary occlusion. A territorial circumferential strain value {\textgreater}-10.0\% had 90\% sensitivity, 88\% specificity and area under the curve=0.93 for identification of acute occlusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NSTEMI due to acute coronary occlusions develop larger infarcts and more impaired left ventricular function than patients with NSTEMI without occlusions, regardless of infarct-related territory. Territorial circumferential strain by echocardiography enables very early identification of acute coronary occlusions in patients with NSTE-ACS and may be used for detection of patients requiring urgent revascularisation.},

	abstract = {Objective To systematically examine the design, reporting standards, risk of bias, and claims of studies comparing the performance of diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging with that of expert clinicians.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization trial registry from 2010 to June 2019.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised trial registrations and non-randomised studies comparing the performance of a deep learning algorithm in medical imaging with a contemporary group of one or more expert clinicians. Medical imaging has seen a growing interest in deep learning research. The main distinguishing feature of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning is that when CNNs are fed with raw data, they develop their own representations needed for pattern recognition. The algorithm learns for itself the features of an image that are important for classification rather than being told by humans which features to use. The selected studies aimed to use medical imaging for predicting absolute risk of existing disease or classification into diagnostic groups (eg, disease or non-disease). For example, raw chest radiographs tagged with a label such as pneumothorax or no pneumothorax and the CNN learning which pixel patterns suggest pneumothorax.
Review methods Adherence to reporting standards was assessed by using CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) for randomised studies and TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) for non-randomised studies. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised studies and PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) for non-randomised studies.
Results Only 10 records were found for deep learning randomised clinical trials, two of which have been published (with low risk of bias, except for lack of blinding, and high adherence to reporting standards) and eight are ongoing. Of 81 non-randomised clinical trials identified, only nine were prospective and just six were tested in a real world clinical setting. The median number of experts in the comparator group was only four (interquartile range 2-9). Full access to all datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 95\% and 93\% of studies, respectively). The overall risk of bias was high in 58 of 81 studies and adherence to reporting standards was suboptimal ({\textless}50\% adherence for 12 of 29 TRIPOD items). 61 of 81 studies stated in their abstract that performance of artificial intelligence was at least comparable to (or better than) that of clinicians. Only 31 of 81 studies (38\%) stated that further prospective studies or trials were required.
Conclusions Few prospective deep learning studies and randomised trials exist in medical imaging. Most non-randomised trials are not prospective, are at high risk of bias, and deviate from existing reporting standards. Data and code availability are lacking in most studies, and human comparator groups are often small. Future studies should diminish risk of bias, enhance real world clinical relevance, improve reporting and transparency, and appropriately temper conclusions.

	abstract = {According to the STEMI paradigm, only patients whose ECGs meet STEMI criteria require immediate reperfusion. This leads to reperfusion delays and significantly increases the mortality for the quarter of “non-STEMI” patients with totally occluded arteries. The Occlusion MI (OMI) paradigm has developed advanced ECG interpretation to identify this high-risk group, including examining the ECG in totality and assessing ST/T changes in proportion to the QRS. If neural networks are only developed based on STEMI databases and to identify STEMI criteria, they will simply reinforce a failed paradigm. But if deep learning is trained to identify OMI it could revolutionize patient care. This article reviews the paradigm shift from STEMI and OMI, and examines the potential and pitfalls of deep learning. This is based on the Kenichi Harumi Plenary Address at the Annual Meeting of the International Society of Computers in Electrocardiology, given by OMI expert Dr. Stephen Smith.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiography is one of the most frequently used methods to evaluate cardiovascular diseases. However, the last decade has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) can extract information from the electrocardiogram (ECG) that goes beyond traditional diagnostics, such as predicting a persons age. In this study, we trained two different 1-dimensional CNNs on open datasets to predict age from a persons ECG.
The models were trained and validated using 10 seconds long 12-lead ECG records, resampled to 100Hz. 59355 ECGs were used for training and cross-validation, while 21748 ECGs from a separate cohort were used as the test set. We compared the performance achieved on the cross-validation with the performance on the test set. Furthermore, we used cardiologist annotated cardiovascular conditions to categorize the patients in the test set in order to assess whether some cardiac condition leads to greater discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age.
The best CNN model, using an Inception Time architecture, showed a significant drop in performance, in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), from cross-validation on the training set (7.90 ± 0.04 years) to the performance on the test set (8.3 years). On the other hand, the mean squared error (MSE) improved from the training set (117.5 ± 2.7 years{\textasciicircum}2) to the test set (111 years{\textasciicircum}2). We also observed that the cardiovascular condition that showed the highest deviation between predicted and biological age, in terms of MAE, was the patients with pacing rhythm (10.5 years), while the patients with prolonged QT-interval had the smallest deviation (7.4 years) in terms of MAE.
This work contributes to existing knowledge of age prediction using deep CNNs on ECGs by showing how a trained model performs on a test set from a separate cohort to that used in the training set.},

We developed and validated a deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DLA) for detecting MI using 6-lead ECG. A total of 412,461 ECGs were used to develop a variational autoencoder (VAE) that reconstructed precordial 6-lead ECG using limb 6-lead ECG. Data from 9536, 1301, and 1768 ECGs of adult patients who underwent coronary angiography within 24 h from each ECG were used for development, internal and external validation, respectively. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLA with VAE using a 6-lead ECG were 0.880 and 0.854, respectively, and the performances were preserved by the territory of the coronary lesion. Our DLA successfully detected MI using a 12-lead ECG or a 6-lead ECG. The results indicate that MI could be detected not only with a conventional 12 lead ECG but also with a life type 6-lead ECG device that employs our DLA.},

This study assesses the utility of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in HF risk prediction.Data from the baseline visits (1987–89) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study was used. Incident hospitalized HF events were ascertained by ICD codes. Participants with good quality baseline ECGs were included. Participants with prevalent HF were excluded. ECG-artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict HF was created as a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing standard 12-lead ECG. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate prediction models including (CNN), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 14 613 (45\% male, 73\% of white, mean age ± standard deviation of 54 ± 5) participants were eligible. A total of 803 (5.5\%) participants developed HF within 10 years from baseline. Convolutional neural network utilizing solely ECG achieved an AUC of 0.756 (0.717–0.795) on the hold-out test data. ARIC and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) HF risk calculators yielded AUC of 0.802 (0.750–0.850) and 0.780 (0.740–0.830). The highest AUC of 0.818 (0.778–0.859) was obtained when ECG-AI model output, age, gender, race, body mass index, smoking status, prevalent coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were used as predictors of HF within LGBM. The ECG-AI model output was the most important predictor of HF.ECG-AI model based solely on information extracted from ECG independently predicts HF with accuracy comparable to existing FHS and ARIC risk calculators.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

An ECG is measured by using an electrocardiograph, and today’s electrocardiographs use built-in software to interpret the ECGs automatically after they are recorded. However, these algorithms show limited performance, and therefore clinicians usually have to manually interpret the ECG, regardless of whether an algorithm has interpreted the ECG or not. Manual interpretation of the ECG can be time-consuming and require specific skills. Therefore, a better algorithm is clearly needed to make correct ECG interpretations more accessible and time efficient. Algorithms based on artificial intelligence have shown promising performance in many fields, including ECG interpretation, over the last few years and might represent an alternative to manual ECG interpretation.},

	abstract = {Objective: Vast 12-lead ECGs repositories provide opportunities to develop new machine learning approaches for creating accurate and automatic diagnostic systems for cardiac abnormalities. However, most 12-lead ECG classification studies are trained, tested, or developed in single, small, or relatively homogeneous datasets. In addition, most algorithms focus on identifying small numbers of cardiac arrhythmias that do not represent the complexity and difficulty of ECG interpretation. This work addresses these issues by providing a standard, multi-institutional database and a novel scoring metric through a public competition: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. Approach: A total of 66 361 12-lead ECG recordings were sourced from six hospital systems from four countries across three continents; 43 101 recordings were posted publicly with a focus on 27 diagnoses. For the first time in a public competition, we required teams to publish open-source code for both training and testing their algorithms, ensuring full scientific reproducibility. Main results: A total of 217 teams submitted 1395 algorithms during the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches for identifying cardiac abnormalities from both academia and industry. As with previous Challenges, high-performing algorithms exhibited significant drops (10\%) in performance on the hidden test data. Significance: Data from diverse institutions allowed us to assess algorithmic generalizability. A novel evaluation metric considered different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, capturing the outcomes and risks of different diagnoses. Requiring both trained models and code for training models improved the generalizability of submissions, setting a new bar in reproducibility for public data science competitions.},

	abstract = {The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 focused on the identification of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiograms (ECGs) and assessed the diagnostic potential of reduced-lead ECGs relative to the standard but less-accessible twelve-lead ECG. We sourced 131,155 recordings with clinical diagnoses from seven institutions in four countries, sharing 88,253 annotated recordings publicly and withholding the remaining recordings for validation and testing. We asked the Challenge participants to design working, open-source algorithms for identifying cardiac abnormalities from twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead ECG recordings. By sourcing data from diverse populations, requiring the submission of reusable training code, and designing an evaluation metric specifically for this task, we encouraged the development of generalizable, reproducible, and clinically relevant algorithms for identifying cardiac abnormalities from ECGs. A total of 68 teams submitted a total of 1056 algorithms during the Challenge. Of these, 39 teams were ultimately successful, representing a diversity of approaches from both academia and industry.},

	abstract = {A dataset of 12-lead ECGs with annotations. The dataset contains 345 779 exams from 233 770 patients. It was obtained through stratified sampling from the CODE dataset ( 15\% of the patients). The data was collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais in the period between 2010 and 2016. This repository contains the files `exams.csv` and the files `exams\_part\{i\}.zip` for i = 0, 1, 2, ... 17.  "exams.csv": is a comma-separated values (csv) file containing the columns "exam\_id": id used for identifying the exam; "age": patient age in years at the moment of the exam; "is\_male": true if the patient is male; "nn\_predicted\_age": age predicted by a neural network to the patient. As described in the paper "Deep neural network estimated electrocardiographic-age as a mortality predictor" bellow. "1dAVb": Whether or not the patient has 1st degree AV block; "RBBB": Whether or not the patient has right bundle branch block; "LBBB": Whether or not the patient has left bundle branch block; "SB": Whether or not the patient has sinus bradycardia; "AF": Whether or not the patient has atrial fibrillation; "ST": Whether or not the patient has sinus tachycardia; "patient\_id": id used for identifying the patient; "normal\_ecg": True if the patient has a normal ECG; "death": true if the patient dies in the follow-up time. This data is available only in the first exam of the patient. Other exams will have this as an empty field; "timey": if the patient dies it is the time to the death of the patient. If not, it is the follow-up time. This data is available only in the first exam of the patient. Other exams will have this as an empty field; "trace\_file": identify in which hdf5 file the file corresponding to this patient is located. "exams\_part\{i\}.hdf5": The HDF5 file containing two datasets named `tracings` and other named `exam\_id`. The `exam\_id` is a tensor of dimension `(N,)` containing the exam id (the same as in the csv file) and the dataset `tracings` is a `(N, 4096, 12)` tensor containing the ECG tracings in the same order. The first dimension corresponds to the different exams; the second dimension corresponds to the 4096 signal samples; the third dimension to the 12 different leads of the ECG exams in the following order: `\{DI, DII, DIII, AVR, AVL, AVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6\}`. The signals are sampled at 400 Hz. Some signals originally have a duration of 10 seconds (10 * 400 = 4000 samples) and others of 7 seconds (7 * 400 = 2800 samples). In order to make them all have the same size (4096 samples), we fill them with zeros on both sizes. For instance, for a 7 seconds ECG signal with 2800 samples we include 648 samples at the beginning and 648 samples at the end, yielding 4096 samples that are then saved in the hdf5 dataset.  In python, one can read this file using h5py. ```python import h5py f = h5py.File(path\_to\_file, 'r') \# Get ids traces\_ids = np.array(self.f['id\_exam']) x = f['signal'] ``` The `signal` dataset is too large to fit in memory, so don't convert it to a numpy array all at once. It is possible to access a chunk of it using: ``x[start:end, :, :]``. The CODE dataset was collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) in the period between 2010 and 2016.

It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.},

	abstract = {Early and accurate detection of myocardial infarction is imperative for reducing the mortality rate due to heart attack. Present work proposes a novel technique aiming toward accurate and timely detection of inferior myocardial infarction (IMI). Stationary wavelet transform has been used to decompose the segmented multilead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal into different sub-bands. Sample entropy, normalized sub-band energy, log energy entropy, and median slope calculated over selected bands of multilead ECG are used as features. Support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) have been used to classify between subjects admitted for health control (HC) and patients suffering from IMI, using attributes selected on the basis of gain ratio. The full length ECG of lead II, III, and aVF of all the subjects having IMI or admitted for HC from Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Database (PTB-DB) has been used in the present work. The proposed technique has been scrutinized under both “class-oriented,” and more practical, “subject-oriented” approach. Under the class-oriented approach, data have been divided into training and test data irrespective of the patients, whereas in subject-oriented approach, data from one patient have been used for test and training has been done on the rest of the subjects. Under the class-oriented approach, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Roc), sensitivity (Se\%), specificity (Sp\%), positive predictivity (+P\%), and accuracy (Ac\%) is Roc \$\$=\$\$0.9945, Se\% \$\$=\$\$98.67, Sp\% \$\$=\$\$98.72, +P\% \$\$=\$\$98.79, Ac\% \$\$=\$\$98.69 using KNN and Roc \$\$=\$\$0.9994, Se\% \$\$=\$\$99.35, Sp\% \$\$=\$\$98.29, +P\% \$\$=\$\$98.41, Ac\% \$\$=\$\$98.84 using SVM. For the subject-oriented approach, an average Ac\% \$\$=\$\$81.71, Se\% \$\$=\$\$79.01, Sp\% \$\$=\$\$79.26, and +P\% \$\$=\$\$80.25 has been achieved. This shows the potential of the proposed technique to work for an unknown subject, on which it has not been trained.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {Cardiac auscultation – even with its limitations – is still a valid and economical technique for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, and despite the growing demand for sophisticated imaging techniques, clinical use of the stethoscope in medical practice has not yet been abandoned. In 1816, René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laënnec invented the stethoscope, while examining a young woman with suspected heart disease, giving rise to mediated auscultation. He described in detail several heart and lung sounds, correlating them with postmortem pathology. Even today, a correct interpretation of heart sounds, integrated with the clinical history and physical examination, allows to detect properly most of the structural heart abnormalities or to evaluate them in a differential diagnosis. However, the lack of organic teaching of auscultation and its inadequate practice have a negative impact on the clinical competence of physicians in training, also reflecting a diminished academic interest in physical semiotic. Medical simulation could be an effective instructional tool in teaching and deepening auscultation. Handheld ultrasound devices could be used for screening or for integrating and improving auscultatory abilities of physicians; the electronic stethoscope, with its new digital capabilities, will help to achieve a correct diagnosis. The availability of innovative representations of the sounds with phono- and spectrograms provides an important aid in diagnosis, in teaching practice and pedagogy. Technological innovations, despite their undoubted value, must complement and not supplant a complete physical examination; clinical auscultation remains an important and cost-effective screening method for the physicians in cardiorespiratory diagnosis. Cardiac auscultation has a future, and the stethoscope has not yet become a medical heirloom.},

	abstract = {In the past few decades heart sound signals (i.e., phono-cardiograms or PCGs) have been widely studied. Automated heart sound segmentation and classification techniques have the potential to screen for pathologies in a variety of clinical applications. However, comparative analyses of algorithms in the literature have been hindered by the lack of a large and open database of heart sound recordings. The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2016 addresses this issue by assembling the largest public heart sound database, aggregated from eight sources obtained by seven independent research groups around the world. The database includes 4,430 recordings taken from 1,072 subjects, totalling 233,512 heart sounds collected from both healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions such as heart valve disease and coronary artery disease. These recordings were collected using heterogeneous equipment in both clinical and nonclinical (such as in-home visits). The length of recording varied from several seconds to several minutes. Additional data provided include subject demographics (age and gender), recording information (number per patient, body location, and length of recording), synchronously recorded signals (such as ECG), sampling frequency and sensor type used. Participants were asked to classify recordings as normal, abnormal, or not possible to evaluate (noisy/uncertain). The overall score for an entry was based on a weighted sensitivity and specificity score with respect to manual expert annotations. A brief description of a baseline classification method is provided, including a description of open source code, which has been provided in association with the Challenge. The open source code provided a score of 0.71 (Se=0.65 Sp=0.76). During the official phase of the competition, a total of 48 teams submitted 348 open source entries, with a highest score of 0.86 (Se=0.94 Sp=0.78).},

	abstract = {This paper brings deep learning at the forefront of research into time series classification (TSC). TSC is the area of machine learning tasked with the categorization (or labelling) of time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE cannot be applied to many real-world datasets because of its high training time complexity in \$\$O(N{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}cdot T{\textasciicircum}4)\$\$for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 8 days to learn from a small dataset with \$\$N=1500\$\$time series of short length \$\$T=46\$\$. Meanwhile deep learning has received enormous attention because of its high accuracy and scalability. Recent approaches to deep learning for TSC have been scalable, but less accurate than HIVE-COTE. We introduce InceptionTime—an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime is on par with HIVE-COTE in terms of accuracy while being much more scalable: not only can it learn from 1500 time series in one hour but it can also learn from 8M time series in 13 h, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

A lot of progress has been made but crucial gaps still exist. The findings of this review paper are as follows: there is a lack of consensus in research outputs; inter-patient adaptability of signal processing algorithm is still problematic; the process of clinical validation of analysis techniques was not sufficiently rigorous in most of the reviewed literature; and as such data integrity and measurement are still in doubt, which most of the time led to inaccurate interpretation of results. In addition, the existing diagnostic systems are too complex and expensive. The paper concluded that the ability to correctly acquire, analyse and interpret heart sound signals for improved clinical diagnostic processes has become a priority.},

Hence, heart sound analysis by auscultation is the primary test conducted by physicians to assess the condition of the heart. Yet, heart sound analysis by auscultation as well as analysis of the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal have not gained widespread acceptance. This is due mainly to many controversies regarding the genesis of the sounds and the lack of quantitative techniques for reliable analysis of the signal features. The heart sound signal has much more information than can be assessed by the human ear or by visual inspection of the signal tracings on paper as currently practiced.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There have been few studies of the cardiac auscultation skills of residents and family physicians. This study assessed a group of family physicians' cardiac auscultation skills and use of a computerized self-instructional program to improve these skills.
METHODS: Forty-two volunteer family physicians participated in an initial assessment of cardiac auscultation skills using test recordings of 12 common heart sounds. They were provided with a CD-ROM instructional program and were asked to devote 15 hours of self-study to the program and to return in 9 months for reassessment.
RESULTS: The 42 family physicians in the initial assessment identified 39\% of the heart sounds. Twenty-one returned for reassessment and showed significant improvement. Their initial mean score was 4.3 of 12 (35\%), and their final mean score was 8.0 of 12 (67\%). They found the CD-ROM program to be a valuable resource. The feature most liked was the unlimited opportunity to review sounds, cases, and tutorials. Most frequent problems related to computer access or skills. Eleven respondents reported using the program to resolve patient problems in their clinical practices.
DISCUSSION: The cardiac auscultation skills of a group of volunteer family physicians showed low initial scores that improved significantly after self-study with a CD-ROM instructional program. The program was a valuable self-instructional aid, and physicians used it as a resource in clinical practice. However, only 50\% of the initial group completed the self-study and returned for final assessment. Providing more support and assistance in the initial phase, especially with computer use, may enable completion of similar computerized self-study programs.},

Previous studies have shown poor diagnostic accuracy, but most used audio recordings, precluding correlation with visible observations. The training spectrum from medical students (MSs) to faculty has not been tested, to our knowledge.
METHODS: A validated 50-question, computer-based test was used to assess 4 aspects of cardiac examination competency: (1) cardiac physiology knowledge, (2) auditory skills, (3) visual skills, and (4) integration of auditory and visual skills using computer graphic animations and virtual patient examinations (actual patients filmed at the bedside). We tested 860 participants: 318 MSs, 289 residents (225 internal medicine and 64 family medicine), 85 cardiology fellows, 131 physicians (50 full-time faculty, 12 volunteer clinical faculty, and 69 private practitioners), and 37 others.
RESULTS: Mean scores improved from MS1-2 to MS3-4 (P = .003) but did not improve or differ significantly among MS3, MS4, internal medicine residents, family medicine residents, full-time faculty, volunteer clinical faculty, and private practitioners. Only cardiology fellows tested significantly better (P{\textless}.001), and they were the best in all 4 subcategories of competency, whereas MS1-2 were the worst in the auditory and visual subcategories. Participants demonstrated low specificity for systolic murmurs (0.35) and low sensitivity for diastolic murmurs (0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac examination skills do not improve after MS3 and may decline after years in practice, which has important implications for medical decision making, patient safety, cost-effective care, and continuing medical education. Improvement in cardiac examination competency will require training in simultaneous audio and visual examination in faculty and trainees.},

	abstract = {This newly inaugurated research database for 12-lead electrocardiogram signals was created under the auspices of Chapman University and Shaoxing People’s Hospital (Shaoxing Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine) and aims to enable the scientific community in conducting new studies on arrhythmia and other cardiovascular conditions. Certain types of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, have a pronounced negative impact on public health, quality of life, and medical expenditures. As a non-invasive test, long term ECG monitoring is a major and vital diagnostic tool for detecting these conditions. This practice, however, generates large amounts of data, the analysis of which requires considerable time and effort by human experts. Advancement of modern machine learning and statistical tools can be trained on high quality, large data to achieve exceptional levels of automated diagnostic accuracy. Thus, we collected and disseminated this novel database that contains 12-lead ECGs of 10,646 patients with a 500 Hz sampling rate that features 11 common rhythms and 67 additional cardiovascular conditions, all labeled by professional experts. The dataset consists of 10-second, 12-dimension ECGs and labels for rhythms and other conditions for each subject. The dataset can be used to design, compare, and fine-tune new and classical statistical and machine learning techniques in studies focused on arrhythmia and other cardiovascular conditions.,

Subjects with coronary artery disease, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were excluded. We tested whether Age-Gap was correlated with total and cardiovascular mortality. Of 25 144 subjects tested (54\% females, 95\% Caucasian) followed for 12.4 ± 5.3 years, the mean chronological age was 53.7 ± 11.6 years and ECG-derived age was 54.6 ± 11 years (R2 = 0.79, P \&lt; 0.0001). The mean Age-Gap was small at 0.88 ± 7.4 years. Compared to those whose ECG-derived age was within 1 standard deviation (SD) of their chronological age, patients with Age-Gap ≥1 SD had higher all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Conversely, subjects whose Age-Gap was ≤1 SD had lower all-cause and CVD mortality. Results were unchanged after adjusting for CVD risk factors and other survival influencing factors.The difference between AI ECG and chronological age is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Discrepancies between these possibly reflect disease independent biological ageing.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31721-0},
	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning.
Methods
We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95\% CIs.
Findings
We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8·4\%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0·87 (95\% CI 0·86–0·88), sensitivity of 79·0\% (77·5–80·4), specificity of 79·5\% (79·0–79·9), F1 score of 39·2\% (38·1–40·3), and overall accuracy of 79·4\% (79·0–79·9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0·90 (0·90–0·91), sensitivity to 82·3\% (80·9–83·6), specificity to 83·4\% (83·0–83·8), F1 score to 45·4\% (44·2–46·5), and overall accuracy to 83·3\% (83·0–83·7).
Interpretation
An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation.

	abstract = {Background:Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person’s age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health.Methods:We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation.Results:Of 275 056 patients tested, 52\% were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4\% classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51\%) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of {\textless}7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by {\textgreater}7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P{\textless}0.01). In the 27\% of patients where correlation was {\textgreater}0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years).Conclusions:Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.},

Here we hypothesized that a deep neural network (DNN) can predict an important future clinical event, 1-year all-cause mortality, from ECG voltage–time traces. By using ECGs collected over a 34-year period in a large regional health system, we trained a DNN with 1,169,662 12-lead resting ECGs obtained from 253,397 patients, in which 99,371 events occurred. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 on a held-out test set of 168,914 patients, in which 14,207 events occurred. Even within the large subset of patients (n = 45,285) with ECGs interpreted as ‘normal’ by a physician, the performance of the model in predicting 1-year mortality remained high (AUC = 0.85). A blinded survey of cardiologists demonstrated that many of the discriminating features of these normal ECGs were not apparent to expert reviewers. Finally, a Cox proportional-hazard model revealed a hazard ratio of 9.5 (P {\textless} 0.005) for the two predicted groups (dead versus alive 1 year after ECG) over a 25-year follow-up period. These results show that deep learning can add substantial prognostic information to the interpretation of 12-lead resting ECGs, even in cases that are interpreted as normal by physicians.},

The development set used 32,707 cases to train the DLM for estimating the ECG-age, and 8,295 cases were used as the tuning set. The validation set included 30,469 ECGs to follow the outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-cause mortality, heart failure (HF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke (STK), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). Two independent external validation sets (SaMi-Trop and CODE15) were also used to validate our DLM.ResultsThe mean absolute errors of chronologic age and ECG-age was 6.899 years (r = 0.822). The higher difference between ECG-age and chronological age was related to more comorbidities and abnormal ECG rhythm. The cases with the difference of more than 7 years had higher risk on the all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.61, 95\% CI: 1.23–2.12], CV-cause mortality (HR: 3.49, 95\% CI: 1.74–7.01), HF (HR: 2.79, 95\% CI: 2.25–3.45), DM (HR: 1.70, 95\% CI: 1.53–1.89), CKD (HR: 1.67, 95\% CI: 1.41–1.97), AMI (HR: 1.76, 95\% CI: 1.20–2.57), STK (HR: 1.65, 95\% CI: 1.42–1.92), CAD (HR: 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.12–1.37), AF (HR: 2.38, 95\% CI: 1.86–3.04), and HTN (HR: 1.67, 95\% CI: 1.51–1.85). The external validation sets also validated that an ECG-age {\textgreater}7 years compare to chronologic age had 3.16-fold risk (95\% CI: 1.72–5.78) and 1.59-fold risk (95\% CI: 1.45–1.74) on all-cause mortality in SaMi-Trop and CODE15 cohorts. The ECG-age significantly contributed additional information on heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation predictions after considering all the known risk factors.ConclusionsThe ECG-age estimated via DLM provides additional information for CVD incidence. Older ECG-age is correlated with not only on mortality but also on other CVDs compared with chronological age.},

	abstract = {Recent global developments underscore the prominent role big data have in modern medical science. But privacy issues constitute a prevalent problem for collecting and sharing data between researchers. However, synthetic data generated to represent real data carrying similar information and distribution may alleviate the privacy issue. In this study, we present generative adversarial networks (GANs) capable of generating realistic synthetic DeepFake 10-s 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We have developed and compared two methods, named WaveGAN* and Pulse2Pulse. We trained the GANs with 7,233 real normal ECGs to produce 121,977 DeepFake normal ECGs. By verifying the ECGs using a commercial ECG interpretation program (MUSE 12SL, GE Healthcare), we demonstrate that the Pulse2Pulse GAN was superior to the WaveGAN* to produce realistic ECGs. ECG intervals and amplitudes were similar between the DeepFake and real ECGs. Although these synthetic ECGs mimic the dataset used for creation, the ECGs are not linked to any individuals and may thus be used freely. The synthetic dataset will be available as open access for researchers at OSF.io and the DeepFake generator available at the Python Package Index (PyPI) for generating synthetic ECGs. In conclusion, we were able to generate realistic synthetic ECGs using generative adversarial neural networks on normal ECGs from two population studies, thereby addressing the relevant privacy issues in medical datasets.},

	abstract = {Background
Intensive training induces two morphological myocardial typologies of athlete's heart. Endurance training (ET) induces eccentric remodeling, bradycardia and better diastolic filling. Strength training (ST) determines concentric chamber remodelling maintaining a normal heart rate (HR). Aim of the study was to compare ET and ST athletes' heart using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE).

Methods
33 professional ET, 36 ST athletes, and 17 healthy controls (CT) were enrolled. All subjects underwent standard transthoracic echocardiography at rest and STE.

Results
In ET group, HR was lower than ST group and CT group (p {\textless} 0.001; p {\textless} 0.01). ET group had higher E/A ratio than ST group and CT group (p {\textless} 0.01; p {\textless} 0.001). The left ventricular apical circumferential strain in ET group was lower than ST group and CT group (-21.6 ± 4.1\% vs. -26.8 ± 7.7\%, p {\textless} 0.05; vs. -27.8 ± 5.6\%, p {\textless} 0.01). ET group had lower left ventricular twist (LVT) and untwisting (UTW) than ST group (6.2 ± 0.1° vs. 12.0 ± 0.1°, p {\textless} 0.01; -67.3 ± 22.9°/s vs. -122.5 ± 52.8°/s, p {\textless} 0.01) and CT group (10.0 ± 0.1°, p {\textless} 0.01; -103.3 ± 29.3°/s, p {\textless} 0.01). The univariate analysis showed significant correlation between E/A ratio and HR (r = -0.54; p {\textless} 0.001), LVT (r = -0.45; p {\textless} 0.01), UTW (r = 0.24; p {\textless} 0.05). At the multivariate analysis only HR was confirmed as independent predictor of diastolic function in all groups (Beta -0.52; p {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusion
In ET there was a better global systolic and diastolic functional reserve at rest observed with strain analysis and it maybe depended on autonomic modulation.},

	abstract = {Background—It has been postulated that depending on the type of exercise performed, 2 different morphological forms of athlete’s heart may be distinguished: a strength-trained heart and an endurance-trained heart. Individual studies have not tested this hypothesis satisfactorily.

Methods and Results—The hypothesis of divergent cardiac adaptations in endurance-trained and strength-trained athletes was tested by applying meta-analytical techniques with the assumption of a random study effects model incorporating all published echocardiographic data on structure and function of male athletes engaged in purely dynamic (running) or static (weight lifting, power lifting, bodybuilding, throwing, wrestling) sports and combined dynamic and static sports (cycling and rowing). The analysis encompassed 59 studies and 1451 athletes. The overall mean relative left ventricular wall thickness of control subjects (0.36 mm) was significantly smaller than that of endurance-trained athletes (0.39 mm, P=0.001), combined endurance- and strength-trained athletes (0.40 mm, P=0.001), or strength-trained athletes (0.44 mm, P{\textless}0.001). There was a significant difference between the 3 groups of athletes and control subjects with respect to left ventricular internal diameter (P{\textless}0.001), posterior wall thickness (P{\textless}0.001), and interventricular septum thickness (P{\textless}0.001). In addition, endurance-trained athletes and strength-trained athletes differed significantly with respect to mean relative wall thickness (0.39 versus 0.44, P=0.006) and interventricular septum thickness (10.5 versus 11.8 mm, P=0.005) and showed a trend toward a difference with respect to posterior wall thickness (10.3 versus 11.0 mm, P=0.078) and left ventricular internal diameter (53.7 versus 52.1 mm, P=0.055). With respect to cardiac function, there were no significant differences between athletes and control subjects in left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and E/A ratio.

Conclusions—Results of this meta-analysis regarding athlete’s heart confirm the hypothesis of divergent cardiac adaptations in dynamic and static sports. Overall, athlete’s heart demonstrated normal systolic and diastolic cardiac functions.},

	abstract = {Athlete's heart is the term given to the complex of structural, functional, and electrical remodelling that accompanies regular athletic training. It is an important physiological adaption which helps athletes perform better in physical tasks than non-athletes and one of the physiological changes that may make a good athlete great. The fact that the heart of an athlete is different to the non-athlete's was recognised in the late 19th century based on clinical examination, with the recognition of cardiac enlargement and bradycardia among more highly trained athletes. Our understanding of this syndrome has gradually expanded in parallel with the development of new invasive and non-invasive tools for the examination of cardiac structure and function. Initially, the chest x-ray and ECG demonstrated important features of cardiac chamber enlargement in athletes. The next steps incorporated invasive haemodynamic measures at rest and with exercise. An additional source of understanding of the athlete's heart has been examination of cardiac pathology specimens. More recently the use of imaging techniques such as echocardiography and cardiac MRI have played a central role in advancing our understanding of what constitutes an athlete's heart and in applying this information in clinical settings.

Study of the athlete's heart has been undertaken and is important for a number of key reasons: first, to understand how cardiac adaptation contributes to improved athletic performance; second, to guide development of training regimens which will optimise cardiac adaptation and thus enhance athletic performance; and third, to allow differentiation of the normal athlete's heart from important disease states which may share similar morphologic features. It is the third of these reasons that has assumed most importance in the cardiology and sports medicine worlds.

The aim of this article is for clinicians to learn about the key features of the athlete's heart and to understand concepts used to …},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Prehospital thrombolytic therapy given by ambulance emergency medical services to patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may produce earlier reperfusion than percutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical results from prehospital thrombolytic therapy in rural areas are scarce.
METHODS:: We studied outcomes during 11 years of a prehospital thrombolytic therapy system in rural sub-arctic Norway. Ambulance personnel gave protocol basic treatment and transmitted electrocardiograms to hospital physicians who made the decision for prehospital thrombolytic therapy. The study was divided into three time periods; 2000-2003, 2004-2007 and 2008-2011.
RESULTS:: A total of 385 STEMI patients received prehospital thrombolytic therapy, median patient age was 61.2 years, and 77\% were men. Time saved by prehospital reperfusion therapy was 131 minutes. The proportion who got prehospital thrombolytic therapy within 2 hours of symptom onset increased from 21\% in 2000-2003 to 39\% in 2008-2011 ( P=0.003). The proportion who underwent coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 hours of first medical contact increased from 56.4\% to 95.4\% ( P{\textless}0.001). Post-STEMI systolic heart failure decreased from 19.4\% to 8.1\% ( P=0.02), while 1-year mortality fell, non-significantly, by 50\% over time to reach 5.6\%. Thirteen patients suffered acute out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; all were successfully defibrillated. Ten patients had major bleeding events (2.6\%).
CONCLUSION:: A decentralised prehospital thrombolytic therapy system based on ambulance personnel, telemetry and centralised 7/24 invasive diagnosis and treatment service, combined with system maturation over time, was associated with earlier reperfusion, improved clinical outcomes and better survival. Prehospital thrombolytic therapy is a feasible and safe intervention used in rural settings with long evacuation lines to percutaneous coronary intervention facilities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that strain echocardiography might improve arrhythmic risk stratification in patients after myocardial infarction (MI).
BACKGROUND: Prediction of ventricular arrhythmias after MI is challenging. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {\textless}35\% is the main parameter for selecting patients for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter study, 569 patients {\textgreater}40 days after acute MI were included, 268 of whom had ST-segment elevation MIs and 301 non-ST-segment elevation MIs. By echocardiography, global strain was assessed as average peak longitudinal systolic strain from 16 left ventricular segments. Time from the electrocardiographic R-wave to peak negative strain was assessed in each segment. Mechanical dispersion was defined as the standard deviation from these 16 time intervals, reflecting contraction heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Ventricular arrhythmias, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden death during a median 30 months (interquartile range: 18 months) of follow-up, occurred in 15 patients (3\%). LVEFs were reduced (48 ± 17\% vs. 55 ± 11\%, p {\textless} 0.01), global strain was markedly reduced (-14.8 ± 4.7\% vs. -18.2 ± 3.7\%, p = 0.001), and mechanical dispersion was increased (63 ± 25 ms vs. 42 ± 17 ms, p {\textless} 0.001) in patients with arrhythmias compared with those without. Mechanical dispersion was an independent predictor of arrhythmic events (per 10-ms increase, hazard ratio: 1.7; 95\% confidence interval: 1.2 to 2.5; p {\textless} 0.01). Mechanical dispersion and global strain were markers of arrhythmias in patients with non-ST-segment elevation MIs (p {\textless} 0.05 for both) and in those with LVEFs {\textgreater}35\% (p {\textless} 0.05 for both), whereas LVEF was not (p = 0.33). A combination of mechanical dispersion and global strain showed the best positive predictive value for arrhythmic events (21\%; 95\% confidence interval: 6\% to 46\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical dispersion by strain echocardiography predicted arrhythmic events independently of LVEF in this prospective, multicenter study of patients after MI. A combination of mechanical dispersion and global strain may improve the selection of patients after MI for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, particularly in patients with LVEFs {\textgreater}35\% who did not fulfill current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications.},

Due to the possibilities in miniaturization and wearability, photoplethysmography (PPG) has recently gained a large interest not only for heart rate measurement, but also for estimating heart rate variability, which is derived from ECG by convention. The agreement between PPG and ECG-based HRV has been assessed in several studies, but the feasibility of PPG-based HRV estimation is still largely unknown for many conditions. In this study, we assess the feasibility of HRV estimation based on finger PPG during rest, mild physical exercise and mild mental stress. In addition, we compare different variants of signal processing methods including selection of fiducial point and outlier correction. Based on five minutes synchronous recordings of PPG and ECG from 15 healthy participants during each of these three conditions, the PPG-based HRV estimation was assessed for the SDNN and RMSSD parameters, calculated based on two different fiducial points (foot point and maximum slope), with and without outlier correction. The results show that HRV estimation based on finger PPG is feasible during rest and mild mental stress, but can give large errors during mild physical exercise. A good estimation is very dependent on outlier correction and fiducial point selection, and SDNN seems to be a more},

	abstract = {Cardiac auscultation is one of the most cost-effective techniques used to detect and identify many heart conditions. Computer-assisted decision systems based on auscultation can support physicians in their decisions. Unfortunately, the application of such systems in clinical trials is still minimal since most of them only aim to detect the presence of extra or abnormal waves in the phonocardiogram signal, i.e., only a binary ground truth variable (normal vs abnormal) is provided. This is mainly due to the lack of large publicly available datasets, where a more detailed description of such abnormal waves (e.g., cardiac murmurs) exists. To pave the way to more effective research on healthcare recommendation systems based on auscultation, our team has prepared the currently largest pediatric heart sound dataset. A total of 5282 recordings have been collected from the four main auscultation locations of 1568 patients, in the process, 215780 heart sounds have been manually annotated. Furthermore, and for the first time, each cardiac murmur has been manually annotated by an expert annotator according to its timing, shape, pitch, grading, and quality. In addition, the auscultation locations where the murmur is present were identified as well as the auscultation location where the murmur is detected more intensively. Such detailed description for a relatively large number of heart sounds may pave the way for new machine learning algorithms with a real-world application for the detection and analysis of murmur waves for diagnostic purposes.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) have attracted a great deal of attention given that they are one of the most common causes of mortality every year. With early diagnoses, CVDs can be controlled before reaching the critical stage. Listening to heart sounds has been a common way of evaluating the cardiovascular system. The sound signal generated by the heart’s mechanical activity provides useful information on the operation of the heart valves. Due to human hearing limitations as well as transient and non-stationary nature of heart sounds, diagnosis based on auscultation is difficult and requires training, repetition, and expertise. The purpose of this study is to diagnose and assess the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a disease that most adults suffer from without being aware of it, by using phonocardiogram (PCG) and without the employment of auxiliary tools such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). To this end, PCG signal is first preprocessed using Shannon energy envelope (SEE) and Hilbert-transform (HT). The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used along with the wavelet transform method for feature extraction; superior features are then selected with the genetic algorithm (GA). The accuracy of the proposed method was 98.78 ± 0.95\% and kappa was 98.12 ± 1.48\% with k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier.},

Several computational approaches based on the analysis of the phonocardiograms (PCG) have been proposed to classify heart sounds into normal or abnormal, but most often do not achieve acceptable levels of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) or require the use of special hardware. We propose a novel approach for classification of PCG. First, the system makes use of deep neural networks for computing individual cardiac cycle probabilities, followed by classification using weighted probability comparisons. The system was tested on an extended dataset consisting of a balanced sample of 18179 normal and abnormal cycles, achieving Se and Sp values of 91.3\% and 93.8\% respectively. In addition, the system overcomes previous limitations since it was trained with a balanced sample; also, the decision factor used during the classification stage allows to control the trade-off between Se and Sp, making the proposed system suitable for clinical applications.},

In recent years, coronary artery disease ranks first among the world’s top ten causes of death. Cardiac auscultation is still an important examination for diagnosing heart diseases. Many heart diseases can be diagnosed effectively by auscultation. However, cardiac auscultation relies on the subjective experience of physicians. To provide an objective diagnostic means and assist physicians in the diagnosis of heart sounds at a clinic, this study uses phonocardiograms to build an automatic classification model. This study proposes an automatic classification approach for phonocardiograms using deep learning and ensemble learning with a Savitzky–Golay filter. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is very competitive, and showed that the performance of the phonocardiogram classification model in hold out testing was 86.04\% MAcc (86.46\% sensitivity, 85.63\% specificity), and in ten-fold cross validation it was 89.81\% MAcc (91.73\% sensitivity, 87.91\% specificity).

Prior studies reported that turbulent blood flow due to stenosed coronary arteries causes weak CAD murmurs. Analysis of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals can be useful to detect these murmurs. In this work, we propose a new multi-channel PCG-based system to classify CAD-affected and normal subjects, and it does not require any additional reference signal, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The proposed system simultaneously acquires PCG signals from four different auscultation sites on the chest. It extracts five different features from time and frequency domains of the PCG signals. The two-class classification is done in a machine learning framework by employing an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The classification performances are evaluated for each channel as well as for their combinations. Experimental results show that the proposed sub-band-based spectral features perform well for both clean and noisy data. An accuracy of 82.57\% is obtained using the combination of the signals acquired from tricuspid, mitral, and midaxillary regions. The multi-channel system gives more than 4\% relative improvement over the best performance obtained by its single-channel counterpart, and the proposed features outperform earlier used features.},

This paper proposes deep neural network architectures such as a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and Feed-forward Neural Network (F-NN) for the classification of unsegmented phonocardiogram (PCG) signal. The research paper aims to automate the feature engineering and feature selection process used in the analysis of the PCG signal. The original PCG signal is down-sampled at 500 Hz. Then they are divided into smaller time segments of 6 s epochs. Savitzky–Golay filter is used to suppress the high-frequency noises in the signal by data point smoothening. The processed data was then provided as an input to the proposed deep neural network (DNN) architectures. 1081 PCG records were used for training and validating the proposed DNN models. The Feed-forward Neural Network model with five hidden layers provided a better overall accuracy of 0.8565 with a sensitivity of 0.8673, and specificity of 0.8475. The balanced accuracy of the model was found to be 0.8574. The performance of the model was also studied using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot, which produced an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.857. The classification accuracy of the proposed models was compared to the related works on PCG signal analysis for cardiovascular disease detection. The DNN models studied in this study provided comparable performance in heart sound classification without the requirement of feature engineering and segmentation of heart sound signals.},

The standard acoustic stethoscope, which has been useful for more than a century, cannot process, store, and play back sounds or provide visual display, and teaching is hindered because there is no means to distribute the same sounds simultaneously to more than one listener. Modern portable and inexpensive tools are now available to provide, through digital electronic means, better sound quality with visual display and the ability to replay sounds of interest at either full or half speed with no loss of frequency representation or sound quality. Visual display is possible in both standard waveform and spectral formats. The latter format is readily available and provides certain advantages over the time-honored waveform (phonocardiographic) method. Both methods, however, can and should be used simultaneously. Sound signals obtained electronically may then be subjected to objective visual and numerical analysis, transmitted to distant sites, and stored in medical records. Signal analysis shows early promise for clinical application, such as in the assessment of severity of aortic stenosis and in the separation of innocent from organic murmurs. In addition to their clinical value, these methods provide a critical vehicle for the teaching of cardiac auscultation, a method that can and should be preserved for future generations.},

To determine the state-of-the-art PCG classification algorithm, 48 international teams competed in the PhysioNet (CinC) Challenge in 2016 over the largest benchmark dataset with 3126 records with the classification outputs, normal (N), abnormal (A) and unsure – too noisy (U). In this study, our aim is to push this frontier further; however, we focus deliberately on the anomaly detection problem while assuming a reasonably high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) on the records. By using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks trained with a novel data purification approach, we aim to achieve the highest detection performance and real-time processing ability with significantly lower delay and computational complexity. The experimental results over the high-quality subset of the same benchmark dataset show that the proposed approach achieves both objectives.

BACKGROUND: Prediction of ventricular arrhythmias after MI is challenging. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {\textless}35\% is the main parameter for selecting patients for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter study, 569 patients {\textgreater}40 days after acute MI were included, 268 of whom had ST-segment elevation MIs and 301 non-ST-segment elevation MIs. By echocardiography, global strain was assessed as average peak longitudinal systolic strain from 16 left ventricular segments. Time from the electrocardiographic R-wave to peak negative strain was assessed in each segment. Mechanical dispersion was defined as the standard deviation from these 16 time intervals, reflecting contraction heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Ventricular arrhythmias, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia or sudden death during a median 30 months (interquartile range: 18 months) of follow-up, occurred in 15 patients (3\%). LVEFs were reduced (48 ± 17\% vs. 55 ± 11\%, p {\textless} 0.01), global strain was markedly reduced (-14.8 ± 4.7\% vs. -18.2 ± 3.7\%, p = 0.001), and mechanical dispersion was increased (63 ± 25 ms vs. 42 ± 17 ms, p {\textless} 0.001) in patients with arrhythmias compared with those without. Mechanical dispersion was an independent predictor of arrhythmic events (per 10-ms increase, hazard ratio: 1.7; 95\% confidence interval: 1.2 to 2.5; p {\textless} 0.01). Mechanical dispersion and global strain were markers of arrhythmias in patients with non-ST-segment elevation MIs (p {\textless} 0.05 for both) and in those with LVEFs {\textgreater}35\% (p {\textless} 0.05 for both), whereas LVEF was not (p = 0.33). A combination of mechanical dispersion and global strain showed the best positive predictive value for arrhythmic events (21\%; 95\% confidence interval: 6\% to 46\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical dispersion by strain echocardiography predicted arrhythmic events independently of LVEF in this prospective, multicenter study of patients after MI. A combination of mechanical dispersion and global strain may improve the selection of patients after MI for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, particularly in patients with LVEFs {\textgreater}35\% who did not fulfill current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications.},

	abstract = {Background
Clinicians vary markedly in their ability to detect murmurs during cardiac auscultation and identify the underlying pathological features. Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform.

Methods and Results
Using {\textgreater}34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 962 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the 4 primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by 3 expert cardiologists. Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3\% and 91.4\%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1 intensity, sensitivity increased to 90.0\%. Application of the algorithm at the appropriate anatomic auscultation location detected moderate‐to‐severe or greater aortic stenosis, with sensitivity of 93.2\% and specificity of 86.0\%, and moderate‐to‐severe or greater mitral regurgitation, with sensitivity of 66.2\% and specificity of 94.6\%.

Conclusions
The deep learning algorithm’s ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists based on the annotated subset of our database. The findings suggest that such algorithms would have utility as front‐line clinical support tools to aid clinicians in screening for cardiac murmurs caused by valvular heart disease.

	abstract = {Objective. Most arrhythmias due to cardiovascular diseases alter the electrical activity, resulting in morphological alterations in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. ECG acquisition is a low-cost, non-invasive process and is commonly used for continuous monitoring as a diagnostic tool for cardiac abnormality identification. Our objective is to diagnose twenty-nine cardiac abnormalities and sinus rhythm using varied lead ECG signals. Approach. This work proposes a deep residual inception network with channel attention mechanism (RINCA) for twenty-nine cardiac arrhythmia classification (CAC) along with normal ECG from multi-label ECG signal with different lead combinations. The RINCA architecture employing the Inception-based convolutional neural network backbone uses residual skip connections with the channel attention mechanism. The Inception model facilitates efficient computation and prevents overfitting while exploring deeper networks through dimensionality reduction and stacked 1-dimensional convolutions. The residual skip connections alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. The attention modules selectively leverage the temporally significant segments in a sequence and predominant channels for multi-lead ECG signals, contributing to the decision-making. Main results. Exhaustive experimental evaluation on the large-scale 'PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge (2021)' dataset demonstrates RINCA efficacy. On the hidden test data set, RINCA achieves the challenge metric score of 0.55, 0.51, 0.53, 0.51, and 0.53 (ranked 2nd, 5th, 4th, 5th and 4th) for the twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead combination cases, respectively. Significance. The proposed RINCA model is more robust against varied sampling frequency, recording time, and data with heterogeneous demographics than the existing art. The explainability analysis shows RINCA potential in clinical interpretations.},

	abstract = {Recently computer-aided diagnosis methods have been widely adopted to aid doctors in disease diagnosis making their decisions more reliable and error-free. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used, noninvasive diagnostic tool for investigating various cardiovascular diseases. In real life, patients suffer from more than one heart disease at a time. So any practical automated heart disease diagnosis system should identify multiple heart diseases present in a single ECG signal. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for the multilabel classification of ECG signals. The proposed method can accurately identify up to two labels of an ECG signal pertaining to eight rhythm or morphological abnormalities of the heart and also the normal heart condition. Also, the black-box nature of deep learning models prevents them from being applied to high-risk decisions like the automated heart disease diagnosis. So in this article, we also establish an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for ECG classification using class activation maps obtained from the Grad-CAM technique. In the proposed method, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with constructed ECG matrices. With the experiments conducted, we establish that training the CNN by taking only one label for each ECG signal data point is enough for the network to learn the features of an ECG point with multilabel information in it (multiple heart diseases at the same time). During classification, we apply thresholding on the output probabilities of the softmax layer of our CNN, to obtain the multilabel classification of ECG signals.We trained the model with 6311 ECG records and tested the model with 280 ECG records. During testing, the model achieved a subset accuracy of 96.2\% and a hamming loss of 0.037 and a precision of 0.986 and a recall of 0.949 and an F1-score of 0.967. Considering the fact that the model has performed very well in all the metrics of multilabel classification, the model can be directly used as a practical tool for automated heart disease diagnosis.},

Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads.

Dependent on the physician's variability, ECG interpretation is subjective and prone to errors. Machine learning models are often developed and used to support doctors; however, their lack of interpretability stands as one of the main drawbacks of their widespread operation. This paper focuses on an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) solution to make heartbeat classification more explainable using several state-of-the-art model-agnostic methods. We introduce a high-level conceptual framework for explainable time series and propose an original method that adds temporal dependency between time samples using the time series' derivative. The results were validated in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset: we performed a performance's analysis to evaluate whether the explanations fit the model's behaviour; and employed the 1-D Jaccard's index to compare the subsequences extracted from an interpretable model and the XAI methods used. Our results show that the use of the raw signal and its derivative includes temporal dependency between samples to promote classification explanation. A small but informative user study concludes this study to evaluate the potential of the visual explanations produced by our original method for being adopted in real-world clinical settings, either as diagnostic aids or training resource.},

	abstract = {Background There is interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Recent work has suggested that image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task. Methods and findings A cross-sectional design with multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation. A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH; 112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH; 42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient Care (IU; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations had an age mean (SD) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and 49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5\%, 44.8\%, and 57.3\%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared performance on different test sets with DeLong’s test. The prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at MSH (34.2\%) relative to NIH and IU (1.2\% and 1.0\%) that merely sorting by hospital system achieved an AUC of 0.861 (95\% CI 0.855–0.866) on the joint MSH–NIH dataset. Models trained on data from either NIH or MSH had equivalent performance on IU (P values 0.580 and 0.273, respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the hospital system used for training data; P values both {\textless}0.001). The highest internal performance was achieved by combining training and test data from MSH and NIH (AUC 0.931, 95\% CI 0.927–0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower external performance at IU (AUC 0.815, 95\% CI 0.745–0.885, P = 0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to generate MSH–NIH cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence between training data sites. When both training data sites had the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently on external IU data (P = 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test performance improved compared to the balanced model (10× MSH risk P {\textless} 0.001; 10× NIH P = 0.002), but this outperformance failed to generalize to IU (MSH 10× P {\textless} 0.001; NIH 10× P = 0.027). CNNs were able to directly detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95\% NIH (22,050/22,062) and 99.98\% MSH (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The primary limitation of our approach and the available public data is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be contributing to hospital system–specific biases. Conclusion Pneumonia-screening CNNs achieved better internal than external performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these sites but not on external data. CNNs robustly identified hospital system and department within a hospital, which can have large differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has achieved promising performance in detecting common abnormalities from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, diagnostic redundancy exists in the 12-lead ECG, which could impose a systematic overfitting on DL, causing poor generalization. We, therefore, hypothesized that finding an optimal lead subset of the 12-lead ECG to eliminate the redundancy would help improve the generalizability of DL-based models. In this study, we developed and evaluated a DL-based model that has a feature extraction stage, an ECG-lead subset selection stage and a decision-making stage to automatically interpret multiple common ECG abnormality types. The data analysed in this study consisted of 6877 12-lead ECG recordings from CPSC 2018 (labelled as normal rhythm or eight types of ECG abnormalities, split into training (approx. 80\%), validation (approx. 10\%) and test (approx. 10\%) sets) and 3998 12-lead ECG recordings from PhysioNet/CinC 2020 (labelled as normal rhythm or four types of ECG abnormalities, used as external text set). The ECG-lead subset selection module was introduced within the proposed model to efficiently constrain model complexity. It detected an optimal 4-lead ECG subset consisting of leads II, aVR, V1 and V4. The proposed model using the optimal 4-lead subset significantly outperformed the model using the complete 12-lead ECG on the validation set and on the external test dataset. The results demonstrated that our proposed model successfully identified an optimal subset of 12-lead ECG; the resulting 4-lead ECG subset improves the generalizability of the DL model in ECG abnormality interpretation. This study provides an outlook on what channels are necessary to keep and which ones may be ignored when considering an automated detection system for cardiac ECG abnormalities.

Hospitalizations including CHD surgery were excluded.
RESULTS: Of 465,482 CHD hospitalizations, AHF was present in 2,712 (0.6\%) [58\% infant, 55\% male, 30\% single ventricle]. AHF therapies frequently used included extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (15\%) and cardiac transplant (16\%).

Hospital mortality in CHD with AHF was 26\%, with higher mortality associated with single ventricle heart disease (OR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.23-2.19; P = .0009), infancy (OR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.17-2.5; P = .0057), non-white race (OR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.04-1.59; p=0.0234), and chronic complex comorbidities (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.34-2.30; P {\textless} .0001). Over the 11-year study period, despite the significant increase in CHD-related AHF hospitalizations (P {\textless} .0001), hospital mortality improved (P = .0011). Median hospital costs were \$252,000, a 6-fold increase above those without AHF, and was primarily driven by hospital length of stay (P {\textless} .0001).
CONCLUSION: AHF in children with CHD in uncommon but increasing and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and resource utilization. Approximately 1 in 5 children do not survive to hospital discharge. Many risk factors for mortality may not be modifiable, and further study is needed to identify modifiable risk factors and improve care for this complex population.},

Digitizing the paper-based ECG records into a high-quality signal is critical for further analysis. We formulated the digitization problem as a segmentation problem and proposed a deep learning method to digitize highly noisy ECG scans. Our method extracts the ECG signal in an end-to-end manner and can handle different paper record layouts. In the experiment, our model clearly extracted the ECG waveform with a Dice coefficient of 0.85 and accurately measured the common ECG parameters with more than 0.90 Pearson's correlation. We showed that the end-to-end approach with deep learning can be powerful in ECG digitization. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first approach to digitize the least informative noisy binary ECG scans and potentially be generalized to digitize various ECG records.},

	abstract = {Background

Studies have demonstrated that the current US guidelines based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator may underestimate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) in certain high‐risk individuals, therefore missing opportunities for intensive therapy and preventing CVD events. Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this problem.

Methods and Results

We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using a 13‐year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD‐free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC/AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5\% 10‐year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0\%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8\% of the 480 “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71. In contrast, ML Risk Calculator recommended only 11.4\% to take statin, and only 14.4\% of “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.95, and AUC 0.92. Similar results were found for prediction of “All CVD” events.

Conclusions

The ML Risk Calculator outperformed the ACC/AHA Risk Calculator by recommending less drug therapy, yet missing fewer events. Additional studies are underway to validate the ML model in other cohorts and to explore its ability in short‐term CVD risk prediction.},

	abstract = {Multiclass multilabel classification is the task of attributing multiple labels to examples via predictions. Current models formulate a reduction of the multilabel setting into either multiple binary classifications or multiclass classification, allowing for the use of existing loss functions (sigmoid, cross-entropy, logistic, etc.). Multilabel classification reductions do not accommodate for the prediction of varying numbers of labels per example and the underlying losses are distant estimates of the performance metrics. We propose a loss function, sigmoidF1, which is an approximation of the F1 score that (1) is smooth and tractable for stochastic gradient descent, (2) naturally approximates a multilabel metric, and (3) estimates label propensities and label counts. We show that any confusion matrix metric can be formulated with a smooth surrogate. We evaluate the proposed loss function on text and image datasets, and with a variety of metrics, to account for the complexity of multilabel classification evaluation. sigmoidF1 outperforms other loss functions on one text and two image datasets and several metrics. These results show the effectiveness of using inference-time metrics as loss functions for non-trivial classification problems like multilabel classification.},

Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physicians' gender bias may contribute to gender disparities in cardiovascular testing. We used the Implicit Association Test to examine the association of implicit gender biases with decisions to use cardiovascular tests.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2014, cardiologists completed Implicit Association Tests and a clinical vignette with patient gender randomly assigned. The Implicit Association Tests measured implicit gender bias for the characteristics of strength and risk taking. The vignette represented an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease regardless of patient gender: chest pain (part 1) followed by an abnormal exercise treadmill test (part 2). Cardiologists rated the likelihood of coronary artery disease and the usefulness of stress testing and angiography for the assigned patient. Of the 503 respondents (9.3\% of eligible; 87\% male, median age of 45 years, 58\% in private practice), the majority associated strength or risk taking implicitly with male more than female patients. The estimated likelihood of coronary artery disease for both parts of the vignette was similar by patient gender. The utility of secondary stress testing after an abnormal exercise treadmill test was rated as "high" more often for female than male patients (32.8\% versus 24.3\%, P=0.04); this difference did not vary with implicit bias. Angiography was more consistently rated as having "high" utility for male versus female patients (part 1: 19.7\% versus 9.8\%; part 2: 73.7\% versus 64.3\%; P{\textless}0.05 for both); this difference was larger for cardiologists with higher implicit gender bias on risk taking (P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiologists have varying degrees of implicit gender bias. This bias explained some, but not all, of the gender variability in simulated clinical decision-making for suspected coronary artery disease.},

Methods Nationwide cohort study comprising 691 290 AMI hospitalisations in England and Wales (n=233 hospitals) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project between 1 January 2003 and 30 June 2013.
Results There were 34.5\% (n=238 489) women (median age 76.7 (IQR 66.3–84.0) years; 33.9\% (n=80 884) ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)) and 65.5\% (n=452 801) men (median age 67.1 (IQR 56.9–77.2) years; 42.5\% (n=192 229) STEMI). Women less frequently received 13 of the 16 quality indicators compared with men, including timely reperfusion therapy for STEMI (76.8\% vs 78.9\%; p{\textless}0.001), timely coronary angiography for non-STEMI (24.2\% vs 36.7\%; p{\textless}0.001), dual antiplatelet therapy (75.4\% vs 78.7\%) and secondary prevention therapies (87.2\% vs 89.6\% for statins, 82.5\% vs 85.6\% for ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers and 62.6\% vs 67.6\% for beta-blockers; all p{\textless}0.001). Median 30-day Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score adjusted mortality was higher for women than men (median: 5.2\% (IQR 1.8\%–13.1\%) vs 2.3\% (IQR 0.8\%–7.1\%), p{\textless}0.001). An estimated 8243 (95\% CI 8111 to 8375) deaths among women could have been prevented over the study period if their quality indicator attainment had been equal to that attained by men.
Conclusion According to the ESC ACCA AMI quality indicators, women in England and Wales less frequently received guideline-indicated care and had significantly higher mortality than men. Greater attention to the delivery of recommended AMI treatments for women has the potential to reduce the sex-AMI mortality gap.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL.

Human pose estimation algorithms leverage advances in computer vision to track human movement automatically from simple videos recorded using common household devices with relatively low-cost cameras (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptop computers). In our view, these technologies offer clear and exciting potential to make measurement of human movement substantially more accessible; for example, a clinician could perform a quantitative motor assessment directly in a patient’s home, a researcher without access to expensive motion capture equipment could analyze movement kinematics using a smartphone video, and a coach could evaluate player performance with video recordings directly from the field. In this review, we combine expertise and perspectives from physical therapy, speech-language pathology, movement science, and engineering to provide insight into applications of pose estimation in human health and performance. We focus specifically on applications in areas of human development, performance optimization, injury prevention, and motor assessment of persons with neurologic damage or disease. We review relevant literature, share interdisciplinary viewpoints on future applications of these technologies to improve human health and performance, and discuss perceived limitations.},

	abstract = {Cross-country skiing is a popular Olympic winter sport, which is also used extensively as a recreational activity. While cross-country skiing primarily is regarded as a demanding endurance activity it is also technically challenging, as it contains two main styles (classical and skating) and many sub-techniques within these styles. To further understand the physiological demands and technical challenges of cross-country skiing it is imperative to identify sub-techniques and basic motion features during training and competitions. Therefore, this paper presents features for identification and assessment of the basic motion patterns used during classical-style cross-country skiing. The main motivation for this work is to contribute to the development of a more detailed platform for comparing and communicating results from technique analysis methods, to prevent unambiguous definitions and to allow more precise discussions and quality assessments of an athlete's technical ability. To achieve this, our paper proposes formal motion components and classical style technique definitions as well as sub-technique classifiers. This structure is general and can be used directly for other cyclic activities with clearly defined and distinguishable sub-techniques, such as the skating style in cross country skiing. The motion component features suggested in our approach are arm synchronization, leg kick, leg kick direction, leg kick rotation, foot/ski orientation and energy like measures of the arm, and leg motion. By direct measurement, estimation, and the combination of these components, the traditional sub-techniques of diagonal stride, double poling, double poling kick, herringbone, as well as turning techniques can be identified. By assuming that the proposed definitions of the classical XC skiing sub-techniques are accepted, the presented classifier is proven to map measures from the motion component definitions to a unique representation of the sub-techniques. This formalization and structure may be used on new motion components, measurement principles, and classifiers, and therefore provides a framework for comparing different methodologies. Pilot data from a group of high-level cross-country skiers employing inertial measurement sensors placed on the athlete's arms and skis are used to demonstrate the approach. The results show how detailed sub-technique information can be coupled with physical, track, and environmental data to analyze the effects of specific motion patterns, to develop useful debriefing tools for coaches and athletes in training and competition settings, and to explore new research hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030},
	abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

	title = {Masked {Autoencoders} {Are} {Scalable} {Vision} {Learners}},
	abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

At index ages of 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 years, participants were stratified by total cholesterol level and by cholesterol subfractions. Lifetime risk of CHD was calculated with death free of CHD as a competing event.Among 3269 men and 4019 women, 1120 developed CHD and 1365 died free of CHD during follow-up. At each index age, lifetime risk of CHD increased with higher cholesterol levels, and time to event decreased. At age 40 years, the lifetime risks of CHD through age 80 years for men with total cholesterol levels less than 200 mg/dL (\&lt;5.20 mmol/L), 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.20-6.19 mmol/L), and 240 mg/dL or greater (≥6.20 mmol/L), respectively, were 31\%, 43\%, and 57\%; for women, the lifetime risks were 15\%, 26\%, and 33\%, respectively. Lifetime risks contrasted sharply with shorter-term risks: at age 40 years, the 10-year cumulative risks of CHD were 3\%, 5\%, and 12\% for men, and 1\%, 2\%, and 5\% for women, respectively.Lifetime risk of CHD increases sharply with higher total cholesterol levels for men and women at all ages.

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing `visual explanations' for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that cardiac abnormalities can be detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) using deep machine learning (DL) models. However, most DL algorithms lack interpretability, since they do not provide any justification for their decisions. In this study, we designed two new frameworks to interpret the classification results of DL algorithms trained for 12-lead ECG classification. The frameworks allow us to highlight not only the ECG samples that contributed most to the classification, but also which between the P-wave, QRS complex and T-wave, hereafter simply called 'waves', were the most relevant for the diagnosis. The frameworks were designed to be compatible with any DL model, including the ones already trained. The frameworks were tested on a selected Deep Neural Network, trained on a publicly available dataset, to automatically classify 24 cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead ECG signals. Experimental results showed that the frameworks were able to detect the most relevant ECG waves contributing to the classification. Often the network relied on portions of the ECG which are also considered by cardiologists to detect the same cardiac abnormalities, but this was not always the case. In conclusion, the proposed frameworks may unveil whether the network relies on features which are clinically significant for the detection of cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead ECG signals, thus increasing the trust in the DL models.

The aim of this study is to assess this relationship in resistant hypertension and, in particular, to evaluate whether any QT interval parameter could provide additive information for LVH beyond that obtained from the best electrocardiographic voltage criterion. In a cross-sectional study, 471 resistant hypertensives were submitted to standard 12-lead ECGs, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and 2D echocardiographic examinations. QT interval durations and QRS voltages were measured, and maximum rate–corrected QT interval duration (QTcmax) and dispersion (QTd), and Sokolow’s and Cornell’s voltage product were calculated. Statistical analyses involved bivariate tests and multivariate logistic regression, with LVH as the dependent variable. A total of 383 patients (81\%) had echocardiographic LVH. In bivariate comparisons, both QT interval parameters showed a predictive performance for LVH similar to Cornell’s product, the best ECG voltage criterion. In multivariate analysis, QT parameters and Cornell’s product were independently associated with LVH, after adjustment for other LVH determinants. QTc interval {\textgreater}440 ms1/2 and dispersion {\textgreater}60 ms were associated with a 2-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.8) greater chance of having LVH, whereas Cornell’s product {\textgreater}240 mV·ms implied a 2.6-fold (95\% CI, 1.2 to 6.1) increased chance of LVH. The combination of prolonged QT interval and increased Cornell’s product was associated with a 5.3- to 9.3-fold higher chance of having LVH. Hence, although in isolation, no QT interval parameter performs better for LVH detection than simpler Cornell’s product, it provides additive information and can be used in combination with voltage criteria to refine LVH risk stratification in resistant hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard electrocardiography (ECG) is a specific, but poorly sensitive tool for diagnosis of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. In a large population of subjects with hypertension we tested some standard ECG criteria in their sensitivity and specificity for LV hypertrophy. LV mass at echocardiography was the reference standard.
METHODS: In the setting of the MAVI (MAssa Ventricolare sinistra nel soggetto Iperteso) study, the ECG and echocardiographic tracings of 947 hypertensive subjects were read blindly in a central office.
RESULTS: Prevalence of LV hypertrophy at ECG was 0.6, 3.0, 4.8, 7.1, 11.1, 11.9 and 18.4\%, respectively, using the following criteria: Wilson, typical strain, Romhilt-Estes score {\textgreater} or = 5 points, Gubner-Ungerleider, Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell voltage (S(V3)+R(avL) {\textgreater} 2.8 mV in men or 2.0 mV in women) and Perugia score (positivity of at least one of the following: S(V3)+R(aVL) {\textgreater} 2.4 mV in men or {\textgreater} 2.0 mV in women, a typical strain pattern, or a Romhilt-Estes point score {\textgreater}or = 5). Prevalence of LV hypertrophy at echocardiography ranged from 27.2\% (LV mass {\textgreater} 125 g/m2) to 49.9\% (LV mass {\textgreater} 51.0 g/m2.7). Using the latter gold standard, sensitivity and specificity of the above ECG criteria were 0.8 and 99.6\% (Wilson), 3.8 and 97.9\% (strain), 5.9 and 96.4\% (Romhilt-Estes), 9.7 and 95.6\% (Gubner-Ungerleider), 11.2 and 91.1\% (Sokolow-Lyon), 15.2 and 91.4\% (Cornell), and 22.2 and 85.4\% (Perugia score).
CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of traditional ECG criteria for LV hypertrophy in subjects with hypertension is poor. However, the combination of three highly specific criteria (Romhilt-Estes, LV strain and Cornell) in a cumulative score produces a rise in sensitivity without excessive deterioration of specificity, with a prevalence of LV hypertrophy at ECG of 18.4\%. Traditional interpretation of ECG is valuable and should be reconsidered in the clinical work-up of subjects with hypertension.},

	abstract = {A new microprocessor-assisted cardiac rhythm algorithm (MAC-RHYTHM), based on median QRST subtraction from 10-second electrocardiographic (ECG) data, was prospectively tested on 10,761 ECGs acquired at one of three clinical centers. Atrial waves (P waves, atrial fibrillatory waves, and flutter waves) were detected from the median QRST-subtracted residual signals. Rhythm criteria were applied to the detected atrial waves and their temporal relation to QRS complexes for generating rhythm interpretations. Rhythm statements generated by MAC-RHYTHM were compared against the true rhythm of the ECGs as read by an experienced cardiologist. The results of prospective testing were compared with the results of an earlier retrospective testing using MAC-RHYTHM and a released commercial ECG analysis program on stored ECGs. The prospective results were very similar to the results of MAC-RHYTHM on retrospective data for all the rhythms examined (sinus rhythms, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, junctional rhythms, second degree atrioventricular blocks). For three of the abnormal rhythms, namely, atrial fibrillation, junctional rhythms, and second degree atrioventricular blocks, MAC-RHYTHM gave significantly higher sensitivity in both prospective (87.5\%, 92.2\%, and 80.8\%, respectively) and retrospective (82.0\%, 81.2\%, and 79.6\% respectively) testing than the released commercial ECG analysis program (65.0\%, 39.6\%, and 12.0\% respectively). Similarly, for sinus rhythms, MAC-RHYTHM had significantly higher specificity (prospective, 91.0\% and retrospective, 91.7\%) than the released commercial program (86.5\%). The specificity for the abnormal rhythms remained very high with MAC-RHYTHM (prospective, 99.4\% to 99.7\% and retrospective, 99.1\% to 99.7\%) compared to the released commercial program (99.0\% to 99.9\%). This prospective study also indicated that further work is needed to improve the detection of pacemaker spikes and the interpretation of paced rhythms in 10-second resting ECGs.},

	abstract = {Background:

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is considered a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in younger people. The incidence of HCM-related SCD and its relationship to exercise have not been well studied in large comprehensive studies outside of tertiary care settings. This study sought to estimate the incidence of HCM-related SCD and its association with exercise in a large unselected population.

Methods:

Using the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario database encompassing all deaths attended by the coroner, we identified all HCM-related SCDs in individuals 10 to 45 years of age between 2005 and 2016 (70 million person-years). Confirmation of HCM was based on typical macroscopic and microscopic features (definite HCM-related SCD). Sudden deaths with a prior clinical diagnosis of HCM but no autopsy were considered probable HCM-related SCDs. Cases with typical features but no myofiber disarray were considered possible HCM. The completeness of data was verified in a subset of patients in the Toronto area with the use of a registry of all emergency medical services–attended cardiac arrests, with an autopsy rate of 94\%. To estimate the number of HCM-related aborted cardiac arrests and lives potentially saved by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, all de novo implantations for secondary prevention and all implantations and appropriate shocks for primary prevention in patients with HCM 10 to 45 years of age, respectively, were identified with the use of a registry containing data on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations from all implanting sites throughout Ontario.

Results:

Forty-four, 3, and 6 cases of definite, probable, and possible HCM-related SCDs, respectively, were identified, corresponding to estimated annual incidence rates of 0.31 per 1000 HCM person-years (95\% CI, 0.24–0.44) for definite HCM-related SCD, 0.33 per 1000 HCM person-years (95\% CI, 0.34–0.62) for definite or probable HCM-related SCD, and 0.39 per 1000 HCM person-years (95\% CI, 0.28–0.49) for definite, probable, or possible HCM-related SCD (estimated 140 740 HCM person-years of observation). The estimated annual incidence rate for HCM-related SCD plus aborted cardiac arrest and HCM-related life-threatening arrhythmia (SCD, aborted cardiac arrest, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks) was 0.84 per 1000 HCM person-years (95\% CI, 0.70–1.0). The majority (70\%) of SCDs occurred in previously undiagnosed individuals. Most SCDs occurred during rest (64.8\%) or light activity (18.5\%).

Conclusions:

The incidence of HCM-related SCD in the general population 10 to 45 years of age is substantially lower than previously reported, with most cases occurring in previously undiagnosed individuals. SCDs are infrequently related to exercise.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically transmitted disease and an important cause of morbidity and sudden cardiac death in young people, including competitive athletes. At present, however, few data exist to estimate the prevalence of this disease in large populations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: As part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) Study, an epidemiological study of coronary risk factors, 4111 men and women 23 to 35 years of age selected from the general population of four urban centers had technically satisfactory echocardiographic studies during 1987 through 1988. Probable or definite echocardiographic evidence of HCM was present in 7 subjects (0.17\%) on the basis of identification of a hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricle and maximal wall thickness {\textgreater} or = 15 mm that were not associated with systemic hypertension. Prevalence in men and women was 0.26:0.09\%; in blacks and whites, 0.24:0.10\%. Ventricular septal thickness was 15 to 21 mm (mean, 17 mm) in the 7 subjects. Only 1 of the 7 subjects had ever experienced important cardiac symptoms attributable to HCM, had previously been suspected of having cardiovascular disease, or had obstruction to left ventricular outflow; 4 other subjects had relatively mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve that was insufficient to produce dynamic basal outflow obstruction. ECGs were abnormal in 5 of the 7 subjects. Five other study subjects had left ventricular wall thicknesses of 15 to 21 mm that were a consequence of systemic hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: HCM was present in about 2 of 1000 young adults. These unique population-based data will aid in assessments of the impact of HCM-related mortality and morbidity in the general population and the practicality of screening large populations for HCM, including those comprising competitive athletes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) exists unsuspected and undetected in the general population.
BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease with diverse natural history for which the potential to produce adverse consequences has been emphasized. However, the possibility of this disease remaining clinically dormant for many years has not been as widely appreciated. Certainly, the clinical recognition of previously undiagnosed patients with HCM may be advantageous by permitting risk stratification for sudden cardiac death or for timely pharmacologic therapy when symptoms intervene.
METHODS: We prospectively conducted an echocardiographic survey in 64 primarily rural communities within Minnesota (populations {\textless} 10,000) over a 33-month period.
RESULTS: A total of 15,137 echocardiograms were performed at the request of primary care physicians for the purpose of excluding cardiovascular abnormalities. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was identified in 44 patients during the survey (0.29\%), and 29 of these patients (0.19\% of the 15,137 echocardiograms) had not been previously identified as having cardiac disease or HCM. At diagnosis, ages were 16 to 87 years (mean 57); 14 patients were {\textgreater} or = 60 years of age, and only two were {\textless} 30 years. Twenty-four patients (83\%) had either no or only mild or transient symptoms; 5 (17\%) evidenced severe functional limitation; in eight patients the onset of symptoms had been deferred until {\textgreater} or = 70 years of age. Basal left ventricular outflow obstruction (gradients 20 to 82 mm Hg) was evident in 11 patients (38\%). Relatively mild phenotypic expression of the disease was substantiated by localized patterns of left ventricular wall thickening occurring more commonly than diffusely distributed hypertrophy (48\% vs. 7\%, respectively), and electrocardiograms that were frequently normal (about 25\%) and rarely showed evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (10\%).
CONCLUSIONS: These prospectively assembled data show that HCM may remain clinically dormant and undetected within community-based rural populations for many years (often to advanced ages) with a not inconsequential prevalence similar to that of HCM in the general population.},

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was defined as nondilated ventricular hypertrophy, documented by echocardiography, that was not caused by any known cardiac or systemic disease.
RESULTS: Of the 4064 men and 4016 women who were screened, 13 (0.16\%; 9 men and 4 women) had definite echocardiographic evidence for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence was about 80 per 100,000 adults.

	abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy unexplained by secondary causes and a nondilated left ventricle with preserved or increased ejection fraction. It is commonly asymmetrical with the most severe hypertrophy involving the basal interventricular septum. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is present at rest in about one third of the patients and can be provoked in another third. The histological features of HCM include myocyte hypertrophy and disarray, as well as interstitial fibrosis. The hypertrophy is also frequently associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In the majority of patients, HCM has a relatively benign course. However, HCM is also an important cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope, a family history of sudden cardiac death, and severe cardiac hypertrophy are major risk factors for sudden cardiac death. This complication can usually be averted by implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in appropriate high-risk patients. Atrial fibrillation is also a common complication and is not well tolerated. Mutations in over a dozen genes encoding sarcomere-associated proteins cause HCM. MYH7 and MYBPC3, encoding β-myosin heavy chain and myosin-binding protein C, respectively, are the 2 most common genes involved, together accounting for ≈50\% of the HCM families. In ≈40\% of HCM patients, the causal genes remain to be identified. Mutations in genes responsible for storage diseases also cause a phenotype resembling HCM (genocopy or phenocopy). The routine applications of genetic testing and preclinical identification of family members represents an important advance. The genetic discoveries have enhanced understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCM and have stimulated efforts designed to identify new therapeutic agents.},

In this respect, this article presents HyperKvasir, the largest image and video dataset of the gastrointestinal tract available today. The data is collected during real gastro- and colonoscopy examinations at Bærum Hospital in Norway and partly labeled by experienced gastrointestinal endoscopists. The dataset contains 110,079 images and 374 videos, and represents anatomical landmarks as well as pathological and normal findings. The total number of images and video frames together is around 1 million. Initial experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis systems.

	abstract = {Current coronary care electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring techniques are aimed at detection of cardiac arrhythmias rather than myocardial ischemia. However, in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who undergo reperfusion therapy, monitoring ST-segment deviation could provide an early noninvasive indicator of coronary artery reocclusion. In this study, the admission 12-lead ECGs of patients with initial AMI were used to propose optimal lead locations for ST-segment monitoring. The study population was selected from consecutive Duke University Medical Center admissions during 1965 to 1981 who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) chest pain for no more than 8 hours, (2) initial AMI documented by ECG and 3 of 4 enzyme criteria, (3) ≥0.1 mV (1 mV = 10 mm) of ST elevation in at least 1 of the standard 12 leads (not aVR) on admission ECG, and (4) no ECG evidence of conduction disturbances, ventricular hypertrophy or tachycardia. ST-segment deviation was quantified; AMI location was assigned based on the lead with maximal deviation. Of the 80 patients who had an inferior AMI, lead III was both the most frequent location for ST elevation (94\%) and the most common site with maximal ST deviation. Lead V2 had the highest incidence of ST-segment depression (60\%). In the 68 patients who had an anterior AMI, lead V2 had the highest frequency of ST elevation (99\%). Leads V2 and V3 were the most common sites of maximal elevation. Thus, for monitoring ST deviation, leads III and V2 may be superior to leads II and V1, which are commonly used in arrhythmia monitoring. Studies of patients who have undergone thrombolytic therapy are needed to examine the performance of these leads for detecting coronary artery occlusion.},

The electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern of ST-segment deviation in myocardial infarction is integral to the proper assessment of the location, extent, and functional significance of the infarct but may be modified by the underlying coronary artery anatomy.

Methods
We describe the electrocardiographic findings in two cases of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) associated with three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD).

Results
Both patients had atypical ECG patterns of ST-segment elevation in leads V2, I, and aVL and ST-segment depression with positive T-waves suggestive of extensive subendocardial ischemia in leads II, III, aVF, and V3–V6; acute proximal LAD occlusion and concomitant three-vessel CAD was observed angiographically.

Conclusion
Electrocardiographic changes in proximal LAD STEMI may be modified by the presence of significant atherosclerotic disease elsewhere in the coronary vasculature. Recognition of this ECG pattern may aid the clinician in the rapid identification of high-risk STEMI.},

	abstract = {In a few patients, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) derived from reduced-lead-set configurations do not match the standard ECG. Constructing an ECG from a reduced number of standard leads should minimize this problem because some of the resultant 12 leads would always include [ldquo ]true[rdquo ] standard leads. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of a new reduced-lead-set 12-lead ECG ([ldquo ]interpolated[rdquo ] ECG) with the standard ECG to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias and acute myocardial ischemia. The interpolated ECG uses six standard electrode sites (limb leads plus V1 and V5), from which the remaining four precordial leads (V2, V3, V4, and V6) are constructed. Standard and interpolated ECGs were compared using data from 2 prospective clinical trials involving 649 patients evaluated for 1) chest pain in the emergency department (ischemia group, n = 509) or 2) tachycardias in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory (arrhythmia group, n = 140). Diagnoses were identical between standard and interpolated ECGs for bundle branch and fascicular blocks, left atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, prior inferior myocardial infarction (MI), and the distinction of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction. There was 99\% agreement for prior anterior MI (kappa, .935, P = .000). The percent agreement for acute myocardial ischemia on the initial ECG recorded in chest-pain patients in the emergency department was 99.2\% (kappa, .978, P = .000). Of the 120 patients who had ST events with continuous standard 12-lead ECG monitoring, 116 (97\%) also had criteria for transient ischemia with the interpolated ECG (ie, [Delta ]ST [ge ] 100 [mu ]V in [ge ]1 lead(s) lasting [ge ]1 minute(s). The interpolated 12-lead ECG is comparable to the standard ECG for diagnosing multiple cardiac abnormalities, including wide-QRS-complex tachycardias and acute myocardial ischemia. The advantages of this ECG method are that the standard electrode sites are familiar to clinicians and that eight of the 12 leads are [ldquo ]true[rdquo ] standard leads. Hence, QRS-axis and morphology criteria for diagnosing wide-QRS-complex tachycardia and bundle branch and fascicular blocks are preserved.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for a series of heart or blood vessels abnormality that serves as a global leading reason for death. The earlier the abnormal heart rhythm is discovered, the less severe the sequela and the faster the recovery. Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a main way to detect the electrical activity of heart, is a very important harmless means of predicting and diagnosing CVDs. However, ECG signal has characteristics of complex and high chaos, making it time-consuming and exhausting to interpret ECG signal even for experts. Hence, computer-aided methods are required to relief human burden and reduce errors caused by tiredness, inter- and intra-difference. Deep learning shows outstanding performance on ECG classification studies recent few years. Its hierarchical architecture enables higher-level features obtained and its strong ability to feature extraction contributes to classification project. Latest studies can achieve higher accuracy and efficiency than manual classification by experts. In this paper, we review the existing studies of deep learning applied in ECG diagnosis according to four typical algorithms: stacked auto-encoders, deep belief network, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network. We first introduced the mechanism, development and application of the algorithms. Then we review their applications in ECG diagnosis systematically, discussing their highlights and limitations. Our view about future potential development of deep learning in ECG diagnosis is stated in the final part of this paper.},

	abstract = {Effective detection of arrhythmia is an important task in the remote monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG). The traditional ECG recognition depends on the judgment of the clinicians’ experience, but the results suffer from the probability of human error due to the fatigue. To solve this problem, an ECG signal classification method based on the images is presented to classify ECG signals into normal and abnormal beats by using two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs). First, we compare the accuracy and robustness between one-dimensional ECG signal input method and two-dimensional image input method in AlexNet network. Then, in order to alleviate the overfitting problem in two-dimensional network, we initialize AlexNet-like network with weights trained on ImageNet, to fit the training ECG images and fine-tune the model, and to further improve the accuracy and robustness of ECG classification. The performance evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve the accuracy of 98\% and maintain high accuracy within SNR range from 20 dB to 35 dB. The experiment shows that the 2D-CNNs initialized with AlexNet weights performs better than one-dimensional signal method without a large-scale dataset.},

	abstract = {While colorectal cancer is known to occur in the gastrointestinal tract. It is the third most common form of cancer of 27 major types of cancer in South Korea and worldwide. Colorectal polyps are known to increase the potential of developing colorectal cancer. Detected polyps need to be resected to reduce the risk of developing cancer. This research improved the performance of polyp classification through the fine-tuning of Network-in-Network (NIN) after applying a pre-trained model of the ImageNet database. Random shuffling is performed 20 times on 1000 colonoscopy images. Each set of data are divided into 800 images of training data and 200 images of test data. An accuracy evaluation is performed on 200 images of test data in 20 experiments. Three compared methods were constructed from AlexNet by transferring the weights trained by three different state-of-the-art databases. A normal AlexNet based method without transfer learning was also compared. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher in statistical significance than the accuracy of four other state-of-the-art methods, and showed an 18.9\% improvement over the normal AlexNet based method. The area under the curve was approximately 0.930 ± 0.020, and the recall rate was 0.929 ± 0.029. An automatic algorithm can assist endoscopists in identifying polyps that are adenomatous by considering a high recall rate and accuracy. This system can enable the timely resection of polyps at an early stage.},

Polyps are missed during colonoscopic examination at a rate that varies from 6\% to 27\%. The adenoma miss rate affects colonoscopic surveillance intervals and procedural quality. We aimed to assess the adenoma miss rate and the variables affecting the rate using same-day, quality-adjusted, back-to-back colonoscopies.MethodsThis prospective study was performed at a single institution and included 149 patients. Two consecutive same-day colonoscopies were performed by two experienced endoscopists. The adenoma miss rates and variables affecting the missed adenomas, including polyp characteristics and procedure times, were evaluated.ResultsThe miss rates of polyps, adenomas, and advanced adenomas were 16.8\%, 17\%, and 5.4\%, respectively. The smaller polyps and increased number of polyps detected during the first colonoscopy were more likely to be missed. A longer insertion time during the colonoscopy was correlated with an increased adenoma detection rate.ConclusionsThere was a significant miss rate in the detection of colonic adenomas even in quality-adjusted, back-to-back colonoscopies. The adenoma miss rate can be reduced with a sufficient observation time during colonoscopic insertion. The development of specific technological methods to reduce the adenoma miss rate is necessary.},

In hospital, colonoscopy is a common way to detect colorectal polyps. Colorectal polyps segmentation plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of digestive system related diseases. Therefore, there is a pressure-need for polyp segmentation computer-aided system to help doctors in diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a new, end-to-end fully convolutional neural network structure for segmenting colorectal polyps. This method can directly output a prediction map of the same size as the original image of the input network. We use the CVC-ClinicDB database to evaluate our method.

Moreover, a rising incidence of early-onset CRC is also emerging. The large number of CRC cases poses a growing global public health challenge. Raising awareness of CRC is important to promote healthy lifestyle choices, novel strategies for CRC management, and implementation of global screening programs, which are critical to reducing CRC morbidity and mortality in the future. CRC is a heterogeneous disease, and its subtype affiliation influences prognosis and therapeutic response. An accurate CRC subtype classification system is of great significance for basic research and clinical outcome. Here, we present the global epidemiology of CRC in 2020 and projections for 2040, review the major CRC subtypes to better understand CRC molecular basis, and summarize current risk factors, prevention, and screening strategies for CRC.},

	abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies are periodically screened, biopsied, and resected using surgical tools. Usually, the procedures and the treated or resected areas are not specifically tracked or analysed during or after colonoscopies. Information regarding disease borders, development, amount, and size of the resected area get lost. This can lead to poor follow-up and bothersome reassessment difficulties post-treatment. To improve the current standard and also to foster more research on the topic, we have released the “Kvasir-Instrument” dataset, which consists of 590 annotated frames containing GI procedure tools such as snares, balloons, and biopsy forceps, etc. Besides the images, the dataset includes ground truth masks and bounding boxes and has been verified by two expert GI endoscopists. Additionally, we provide a baseline for the segmentation of the GI tools to promote research and algorithm development. We obtained a dice coefficient score of 0.9158 and a Jaccard index of 0.8578 using a classical U-Net architecture. A similar dice coefficient score was observed for DoubleUNet. The qualitative results showed that the model did not work for the images with specularity and the frames with multiple tools, while the best result for both methods was observed on all other types of images. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the model performs reasonably good, but there is potential for further improvements. Benchmarking using the dataset provides an opportunity for researchers to contribute to the field of automatic endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic tool segmentation for GI endoscopy.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {There are several aspects that might inﬂuence the performance achieved by existing learning systems. It has been reported that one of these aspects is related to class imbalance in which examples in training data belonging to one class heavily outnumber the examples in the other class. In this situation, which is found in real world data describing an infrequent but important event, the learning system may have diﬃculties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work we perform a broad experimental evaluation involving ten methods, three of them proposed by the authors, to deal with the class imbalance problem in thirteen UCI data sets. Our experiments provide evidence that class imbalance does not systematically hinder the performance of learning systems. In fact, the problem seems to be related to learning with too few minority class examples in the presence of other complicating factors, such as class overlapping. Two of our proposed methods deal with these conditions directly, allying a known over-sampling method with data cleaning methods in order to produce better-deﬁned class clusters. Our comparative experiments show that, in general, over-sampling methods provide more accurate results than under-sampling methods considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This result seems to contradict results previously published in the literature. Two of our proposed methods, Smote + Tomek and Smote + ENN, presented very good results for data sets with a small number of positive examples. Moreover, Random over-sampling, a very simple over-sampling method, is very competitive to more complex over-sampling methods. Since the over-sampling methods provided very good performance results, we also measured the syntactic complexity of the decision trees induced from over-sampled data. Our results show that these trees are usually more complex then the ones induced from original data. Random over-sampling usually produced the smallest increase in the mean number of induced rules and Smote + ENN the smallest increase in the mean number of conditions per rule, when compared among the investigated over-sampling methods.},

However, as medical doctors are ultimately responsible for clinical decision-making, any deep learning-based prediction should be accompanied by an explanation that a human can understand. We present an approach called electrocardiogram gradient class activation map (ECGradCAM), which is used to generate attention maps and explain the reasoning behind deep learning-based decision-making in ECG analysis. Attention maps may be used in the clinic to aid diagnosis, discover new medical knowledge, and identify novel features and characteristics of medical tests. In this paper, we showcase how ECGradCAM attention maps can unmask how a novel deep learning model measures both amplitudes and intervals in 12-lead electrocardiograms, and we show an example of how attention maps may be used to develop novel ECG features.},

	abstract = {The searchlight technique is a variant of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) that examines neural activity across large sets of small regions, exhaustively covering the whole brain. This usually involves application of classifier algorithms across all searchlights, which entails large computational costs especially when testing the statistical significance of the accuracies with permutation methods. In this article, a new implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is presented (henceforth massive-GNB). This approach allows classification in all searchlights simultaneously, and is faster than previously published searchlight GNB implementations, as well as other more complex classifiers including support vector machines (SVM). To ensure that the gain in speed for GNB would be useful in searchlight analysis, we compared the accuracies of massive-GNB and SVM in detecting the lateral occipital complex (LOC) in an fMRI localizer experiment (26 subjects). Moreover, this region as defined in a meta-analysis of many activation studies was used as a gold standard to compare error rates for both classifiers. In individual searchlights, SVM was somewhat more accurate than massive-GNB and more selective in detecting the meta-analytic LOC. However, with multiple comparison correction at the cluster-level the two classifiers performed equivalently. Thus for cluster-level analysis, massive-GNB produces an accuracy similar to more sophisticated classifiers but with a substantial gain in speed. Massive-GNB (available as a public Matlab toolbox) could facilitate the more widespread use of searchlight analysis.},

However, only finite samples can be acquired in practice. In this paper, a novel learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is applied on different data (Diabetes data, Heart Data, Satellite Data and Shuttle data) which have two or multi class. SVM, a powerful machine method developed from statistical learning and has made significant achievement in some field. Introduced in the early 90’s, they led to an explosion of interest in machine learning. The foundations of SVM have been developed by Vapnik and are gaining popularity in field of machine learning due to many attractive features and promising empirical performance. SVM method does not suffer the limitations of data dimensionality and limited samples [1] \& [2].},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ECG interpretation requires expertise and is mostly based on physician recognition of specific patterns, which may be challenging in rare cardiac diseases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can discover complex features in ECGs and may facilitate the detection of novel features which possibly play a pathophysiological role in relatively unknown diseases. Using a cohort of PLN (phospholamban) p.Arg14del mutation carriers, we aimed to investigate whether a novel DNN-based approach can identify established ECG features, but moreover, we aimed to expand our knowledge on novel ECG features in these patients. METHODS: A DNN was developed on 12-lead median beat ECGs of 69 patients and 1380 matched controls and independently evaluated on 17 patients and 340 controls. Differentiating features were visualized using Guided Gradient Class Activation Mapping++. Novel ECG features were tested for their diagnostic value by adding them to a logistic regression model including established ECG features. RESULTS: The DNN showed excellent discriminatory performance with a c-statistic of 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.91-0.99) and sensitivity and specificity of 0.82 and 0.93, respectively. Visualizations revealed established ECG features (low QRS voltages and T-wave inversions), specified these features (eg, R- and T-wave attenuation in V2/V3) and identified novel PLN-specific ECG features (eg, increased PR-duration). The logistic regression baseline model improved significantly when augmented with the identified features (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A DNN-based feature detection approach was able to discover and visualize disease-specific ECG features in PLN mutation carriers and revealed yet unidentified features. This novel approach may help advance diagnostic capabilities in daily practice.},

	abstract = {Hjertestans er den vanligste årsaken til plutselig død blant idrettsutøvere. Dette skyldes ofte arvelige hjertesykdommer som blant annet kan oppdages på et elektrokardiogram (EKG). I denne studien ble to problemstillinger undersøkt: (1) Om tolkningsalgoritmene i en klinisk anvendt elektrokardiograf er bedre tilpasset EKG fra den generelle befolkning enn idrettsutøvere? (2) Om moderne metoder, som kunstig intelligens (KI), kunne brukes til å forbedre dagens kliniske anvendte tolkningsalgoritmer slik at de kan bli bedre kalibrert for idrettsutøvere? For å undersøke (1) ble det registrert EKG fra 28 idrettsutøvere ved bruk av en moderne elektrokardiograf. EKGene ble tolket av tolkningsalgoritmen i elektrokardiografen, og sammenlignet med en kardiologs tolkning. Tolkningsalgoritmen klassifiserte 46\% av EKGene som normale, 25\% i grenseområdet og 29\% som unormale. Kardiologen fulgte retningslinjene fra International Criteria, og klassifiserte 93\% som normale og 7\% i grenseområdet. Resultatene viser at tolkningsalgoritmen feilvurderer noen av områdene i EKGet. Dette ga i noen tilfeller alvorlige feilklassifiseringer, som akutt hjerteinfarkt (STEMI). For å undersøke (2) ble et stort åpent datasett av EKGer fra den generelle befolkning tatt i bruk. Ni ulike modeller ble trent, og validert på datasettet, deretter ble fire prediksjoner fra de to beste modellene forklart ved bruk av forklarbar KI. Den beste modellen fikk en PhysioNet/CinC Challenge skår = 0,512±0,006 og en F1-skår=0,405±0,008 ved 10-ganger kryssvalidering. Modellarkitekturene lar seg forklare ved bruk av forklarbar KI. Forklarbarheten er viktig for modellens kliniske relevans. For videre arbeid med disse problemstillingene trengs tilgang til flere EKG fra idrettsutøvere.},

We have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based on 12-lead surface ECGs that attains the accuracy performance level of professional cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs from 40,258 patients with four arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust LOESS, Non Local Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F1-Score of 0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier achieved an F1-Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold cross-validation F1-Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed optimal multi-stage arrhythmia classification approach can dramatically benefit automatic ECG data analysis by providing cardiologist level accuracy and robust compatibility with various ECG data sources.},

Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person’s age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.},

However, it is very labor intensive to externally evaluate ECG signals, due to their small amplitude. Using automated detection and classiﬁcation methods in the clinic can assist doctors in making accurate and expeditious diagnoses of diseases. In this study, we developed a classiﬁcation method for arrhythmia based on the combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, which was then used to diagnose eight ECG signals, including a normal sinus rhythm. The ECG data of the experiment were derived from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The experimental method mainly consisted of two parts. The input data of the model were two-dimensional grayscale images converted from one-dimensional signals, and detection and classiﬁcation of the input data was carried out using the combined model. The advantage of this method is that it does not require performing feature extraction or noise ﬁltering on the ECG signal. The experimental results showed that the implemented method demonstrated high classiﬁcation performance in terms of accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity equal to 99.01\%, 99.57\%, and 97.67\%, respectively.

Human iPSC-CMs can be generated from individuals with diverse genetic backgrounds and varying disease status, which provides unprecedented opportunities to assess drug-induced cardiotoxicity at the population level, ultimately, realizing personalized cardiac safety prediction and permitting mechanistic insights into genetic predisposition of drug-induced cardiotoxicity at the molecular and cellular levels. Reviewed herein are successful applications and limitations in using patient-specific iPSC-CMs for cardiac safety evaluation. Future directions for iPSC-CMs are also discussed. The aim of this review is to promote the further development of human iPSC-CM technology to address existing gaps in drug development, improve the prediction of patient susceptibility to therapeutic drugs, and enhance postmarketing surveillance of severe adverse drug reactions.},

	abstract = {Delineation of the cardiac structures from 2D echocardiographic images is a common clinical task to establish a diagnosis. Over the past decades, the automation of this task has been the subject of intense research. In this paper, we evaluate how far the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural network methods can go at assessing 2D echocardiographic images, i.e., segmenting cardiac structures and estimating clinical indices, on a dataset, especially, designed to answer this objective. We, therefore, introduce the cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation dataset, the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for the purpose of echocardiographic assessment. The dataset contains two and four-chamber acquisitions from 500 patients with reference measurements from one cardiologist on the full dataset and from three cardiologists on a fold of 50 patients. Results show that encoder-decoder-based architectures outperform state-of-the-art non-deep learning methods and faithfully reproduce the expert analysis for the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes, with a mean correlation of 0.95 and an absolute mean error of 9.5 ml. Concerning the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, results are more contrasted with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.80 and an absolute mean error of 5.6\%. Although these results are below the inter-observer scores, they remain slightly worse than the intra-observer's ones. Based on this observation, areas for improvement are defined, which open the door for accurate and fully-automatic analysis of 2D echocardiographic images.},

	abstract = {Drug discovery and development are hampered by high failure rates attributed to the reliance on non-human animal models employed during safety and efficacy testing. A fundamental problem in this inefficient process is that non-human animal models cannot adequately represent human biology. Thus, there is an urgent need for high-content in vitro systems that can better predict drug-induced toxicity. Systems that predict cardiotoxicity are of uppermost significance, as approximately one third of safety-based pharmaceutical withdrawals are due to cardiotoxicty. Here, we present a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS) with the attributes required for an ideal in vitro system to predict cardiotoxicity: i) cells with a human genetic background; ii) physiologically relevant tissue structure (e.g. aligned cells); iii) computationally predictable perfusion mimicking human vasculature; and, iv) multiple modes of analysis (e.g. biological, electrophysiological, and physiological). Our MPS is able to keep human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac tissue viable and functional over multiple weeks. Pharmacological studies using the cardiac MPS show half maximal inhibitory/effective concentration values (IC₅₀/EC₅₀) that are more consistent with the data on tissue scale references compared to cellular scale studies. We anticipate the widespread adoption of MPSs for drug screening and disease modeling.},

	abstract = {Multi-label learning has received signiﬁcant attention in the research community over the past few years: this has resulted in the development of a variety of multi-label learning methods. In this paper, we present an extensive experimental comparison of 12 multi-label learning methods using 16 evaluation measures over 11 benchmark datasets. We selected the competing methods based on their previous usage by the community, the representation of different groups of methods and the variety of basic underlying machine learning methods. Similarly, we selected the evaluation measures to be able to assess the behavior of the methods from a variety of view-points. In order to make conclusions independent from the application domain, we use 11 datasets from different domains. Furthermore, we compare the methods by their efﬁciency in terms of time needed to learn a classiﬁer and time needed to produce a prediction for an unseen example. We analyze the results from the experiments using Friedman and Nemenyi tests for assessing the statistical signiﬁcance of differences in performance. The results of the analysis show that for multi-label classiﬁcation the best performing methods overall are random forests of predictive clustering trees (RF-PCT) and hierarchy of multi-label classiﬁers (HOMER), followed by binary relevance (BR) and classiﬁer chains (CC). Furthermore, RF-PCT exhibited the best performance according to all measures for multi-label ranking. The recommendation from this study is that when new methods for multi-label learning are proposed, they should be compared to RF-PCT and HOMER using multiple evaluation measures.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of ﬁve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a ﬁnal 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.

	abstract = {Coffee is a socioeconomic important plant all over the world due to its exportation and how it provides income to the farmers and the country. However, potato taste defect (PTD) affects the Rwandan coffee quality. The smell is reported to be caused by some bacteria that are responsible for the off-flavor and may also be related to the infestation of Antestia pest which are in its elimination process. The aim of this study was to isolate, biochemically characterize, and identify bacteria producing potato flavor from Rwandan coffee. Five samples were obtained from different regions (Nyamasheke and Nyakizu) of Rwanda. Bacteria were isolated and enumerated in the nutrient agar media followed by culture on nutrient and tryptic soy broth media. Bacteria were also cultured to several carbon sources such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, pectin, and galactose to smell the odor produced by those bacteria. DNA extraction of isolates was done, and the resulting DNA strands were undergone three steps of PCR to be amplified using the forward primer and reverse primer. The identification of bacteria producing potato flavor from Rwandan coffee beans was done through 16S rDNA method followed by sequence analysis using FinchTV software and BLAST. Earthy odor was the mostly produced one for nutrient agar and tryptic soy agar media, and for carbon sources such as sucrose, glucose, pectin, fructose, and galactose. The potato odor was recorded mostly from damaged floaters and hand-sorted damaged coffee beans. However, other odors such as fruity and ferment were found to be produced by bacteria in coffee beans. The study came up by concluding the presence of different kinds of bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae and Pantoea, which are responsible for the formation of 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IMP) in coffee beans and cause the production of potato flavor.},

Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person’s age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.},

Further, the proposed technique is enhanced to calculate the heart rate from the obtained time series to facilitate the evaluation of the methodology. Compared with the manually obtained heart rate, the methodology shows an accuracy of 95\%, demonstrating the usefulness of the approach. Also, elaborate experimentation with the algorithm has brought out the robustness of the methodology in handling ECG traces from different sources.},

Recently, exchanging patients' clinical information between healthcare facilities has become very important. It will be very helpful if paper type of ECG could be converted to digital form. In this study, a morphological method is developed to digitize ECG signal from the paper charts. The results show that the method can erase the background noise and provide the digital ECG signal from ECG paper charts correctly. ECG signal digitization is practically used in ECG data exchanging between healthcare providers.

	abstract = {Objective: We present a Matlab-based tool to convert electrocardiography (ECG) information from paper charts into digital ECG signals. The tool can be used for long-term retrospective studies of cardiac patients to study the evolving features with prognostic value. Methods and procedures: To perform the conversion, we: 1) detect the graphical grid on ECG charts using grayscale thresholding; 2) digitize the ECG signal based on its contour using a column-wise pixel scan; and 3) use template-based optical character recognition to extract patient demographic information from the paper ECG in order to interface the data with the patients' medical record. To validate the digitization technique: 1) correlation between the digital signals and signals digitized from paper ECG are performed and 2) clinically significant ECG parameters are measured and compared from both the paper-based ECG signals and the digitized ECG. Results: The validation demonstrates a correlation value of 0.85-0.9 between the digital ECG signal and the signal digitized from the paper ECG. There is a high correlation in the clinical parameters between the ECG information from the paper charts and digitized signal, with intra-observer and inter-observer correlations of 0.8-0.9 (p {\textless}; 0.05), and kappa statistics ranging from 0.85 (inter-observer) to 1.00 (intra-observer). Conclusion: The important features of the ECG signal, especially the QRST complex and the associated intervals, are preserved by obtaining the contour from the paper ECG. The differences between the measures of clinically important features extracted from the original signal and the reconstructed signal are insignificant, thus highlighting the accuracy of this technique. Clinical impact: Using this type of ECG digitization tool to carry out retrospective studies on large databases, which rely on paper ECG records, studies of emerging ECG features can be performed. In addition, this tool can be used to potentially integrate digitized ECG information with digital ECG analysis programs and with the patient's electronic medical record.},

Digitizing the paper-based ECG records into a high-quality signal is critical for further analysis. We formulated the digitization problem as a segmentation problem and proposed a deep learning method to digitize highly noisy ECG scans. Our method extracts the ECG signal in an end-to-end manner and can handle different paper record layouts. In the experiment, our model clearly extracted the ECG waveform with a Dice coefficient of 0.85 and accurately measured the common ECG parameters with more than 0.90 Pearson's correlation. We showed that the end-to-end approach with deep learning can be powerful in ECG digitization. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first approach to digitize the least informative noisy binary ECG scans and potentially be generalized to digitize various ECG records.},

	abstract = {Background
No established method for digitizing and digital measuring of paper electrocardiograms (ECG) exists. We describe a paper ECG digitizing and digital measuring process, and report comparability to manual measurements.
Methods
A paper ECG was recorded from 7203 health survey participants in 1978–1980. With specific software, the ECGs were digitized (ECG Trace Tool), and measured digitally (EASE). A sub-sample of 100 ECGs was selected for manual measurements.
Results
The measurement methods showed good agreement. The mean global (EASE)-(manual) differences were 1.4ms (95\% CI 0.5–2.2) for PR interval, −1.0ms (95\% CI −1.5–[−0.5]) for QRS duration, and 11.6ms (95\% CI 10.5–12.7) for QT interval. The mean inter-method amplitude differences of RampV5, RampV6, SampV1, TampII and TampV5 ranged from −0.03mV to 0.01mV.
Conclusions
The presented paper-to-digital conversion and digital measurement process is an accurate and reliable method, enabling efficient storing and analysis of paper ECGs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurements of parameters from electrocardiograms (ECGs) are still largely performed from paper ECG records. Recent guidelines from regulatory agencies and, in particular, the requirement of the Food and Drug Administration to enforce the digital submission of annotated ECGs have triggered significant efforts in the pharmaceutical industry, which, to comply with the new guidelines, is adopting digital ECG technology. At the same time, the new requirements justify the need for tools to convert existing paper ECG records into digital format, particularly for retrospective studies.
METHODS: This article presents ECGScan, a computer application developed for the conversion of paper ECG records to digital ECG files. An image processing engine is used to first detect the underlying grid and, subsequently, to extrapolate the ECG waveforms using a technique based on active contour modeling.
RESULTS: ECGScan was validated using a set of 60 ECGs for which both the original digital waveform and paper printouts were available. Sample-by-sample comparisons provided evidence of a robust wave reconstruction (root mean square value from 169 PQRST complexes was 16.8+/-11.8 microV). Semiautomatic measurements of QT intervals performed on 144 complexes also indicated a strong agreement between original and derived ECGs (DeltaQT=0.577+/-5.41 milliseconds).
CONCLUSIONS: ECGScan provides a robust reconstruction of a digital ECG, both in waveform reconstruction and in QT measurements performed on original (digital) ECGs and on digitized ECGs from paper printouts.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in the diagnosis of heart diseases. However, most patterns of diseases are based on old datasets and stepwise algorithms that provide limited accuracy. Improving diagnostic accuracy of the ECG can be done by applying machine learning algorithms. This requires taking existing scanned or printed ECGs of old cohorts and transforming the ECG signal to the raw digital (time (milliseconds), voltage (millivolts)) form. Objectives: We present a MATLAB-based tool and algorithm that converts a printed or scanned format of the ECG into a digitized ECG signal. Methods: 30 ECG scanned curves are utilized in our study. An image processing method is first implemented for detecting the ECG regions of interest and extracting the ECG signals. It is followed by serial steps that digitize and validate the results. Results: The validation demonstrates very high correlation values of several standard ECG parameters: PR interval 0.984 +/−0.021 (p-value {\textless} 0.001), QRS interval 1+/− SD (p-value {\textless} 0.001), QT interval 0.981 +/− 0.023 p-value {\textless} 0.001, and RR interval 1 +/− 0.001 p-value {\textless} 0.001. Conclusion: Digitized ECG signals from existing paper or scanned ECGs can be obtained with more than 95\% of precision. This makes it possible to utilize historic ECG signals in machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of heart diseases and aid in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Simulation is commonly used in the training of medical professionals; including nurses, 
 emergency responders and doctors. By using real equipment with medical simulators it 
 allows for a much more realistic experience, allowing the students to get experience with 
 the actual equipment to be used later with real patients. 
  
 The idea behind this project is to develop methods to allow the simulation of 12 Lead 
 ECG based on real recordings, such that users can connect devices such as patient 
 monitors, defibrillators and electrocardiographs to a simulator and record realistic ECG. 
 In the report it is presented how a 12 Lead ECG with synchronized leads can be calculated 
 into the voltage potentials, which in turn can be generated to the ECG electrodes. 
 It is then showed how the QRS complexes and waves of the ECG is detected. This is 
 used to segment the ECG recording into beats, and a representative beat is found as the 
 median beat of all the segmented beats fulfilling different criteria. The representative 
 beat of the ECG is then modeled by a simple parametric model and it is showed how 
 this can be used for realistic simulation of normal sinus rhythms at different heart rates, 
 as well as presenting signs of conditions like myocardial infarction. 
  
 In the project the simulations were based on the PTB Diagnostic ECG database, a 
 database consisting of 549 ECG recordings from 290 different healthy volunteers or subjects 
 with different heart diseases. In the report it is showed how the voltage potentials 
 required for simulation could be calculated from the records in the database. The ECG 
 was then reconstructed from the voltage potentials with low errors on most records in 
 the database. The parametric model was fit to all the records of the database, and for 
 many records the model seems to represent the ECG quite well. Finally it is showed 
 how rate adjustment and myocardial infarction simulation would look on some of the 
 records in the database.},

	abstract = {Computerised ECG diagnostic programs occasionally provide erratic diagnoses, and false diagnostic suggestions may mislead the physician. We wanted to investigate whether a diagnostic computer program guides or misleads the ECG interpretation in the emergency room. A panel of 20 first-line physicians from the Medical Department at Ullevål Hospital, Oslo, Norway each described sets of ten ECGs, composed from a selection of ten excellent and ten wrong computer interpretations, randomly with or without the print-out of this diagnosis. The presence of correct computer diagnosis resulted in 58\% correct conclusions by the physicians, against 30\% in the absence of the computers conclusions (p {\textless} 0.005). Whether an incorrect computer diagnosis was provided or not, did not significantly influence the physicians' conclusions. Among the physicians, the best performing third benefitted most from the presence of a good computer interpretation, whereas the poor performers did not even recognise the help provided. Computer-based ECG diagnoses seem to be helpful to emergency ward physicians, but a certain level of ECG experience is required to utilise the program.},

To provide the reader with an overview of the many causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and to present various strategies for preparticipation cardiovascular screening.

Data Source:
A MEDLINE search using the phrase sudden cardiac death and the key word athlete for the years 1980 to 2000.

Data Synthesis:
Sudden cardiac death is a rare event in athletics. More than 20 different causes have been described, but most cases result from a few distinct entities. Most afflicted athletes have no symptoms before death. Many attempts have been made to detect those at risk for sudden cardiac death before athletic participation. At this time, a thorough history and physical examination are the most efficient screening methods for detecting cardiovascular abnormalities. Studies show that the current status of preparticipation cardiovascular screening of high school and college athletes nationwide is poor.

Conclusions and Recommendations:
The use of diagnostic tests to screen for cardiovascular abnormalities is ineffective and inefficient. The most prudent and effective methods of preparticipation screening for cardiovascular abnormalities at this time are a history and physical examination in accordance with the American Heart Association guidelines. Athletic trainers must ensure that their institutions comply with these minimum standards.},

In this paper, as part of the PhysioNet / Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020, we developed an 18-layer residual convolutional neural network to classify clinical cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead ECG recordings. We focused on examining a collection of data pre-processing, model architecture, training, and post-training procedure reﬁnements for DNN-based ECG classiﬁcation. We showed that by combining these reﬁnements, we can improve the classiﬁcation performance signiﬁcantly. Our team, DSAIL SNU, obtained a 0.695 challenge score using 10-fold crossvalidation, and a 0.420 challenge score on the full test data, placing us 6th in the ofﬁcial ranking.},

Differential diagnosis between ARVC‐LV phenotype and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was evaluated.Methods and ResultsThe study population included 87 ARVC patients (median age 34 years) and 153 DCM patients (median age 51 years). All underwent cardiac magnetic resonance with quantitative tissue characterization. Fifty‐eight ARVC patients (67\%) had LV involvement, with both LV systolic dysfunction and LV late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in 41/58 (71\%) and LV‐LGE in isolation in 17 (29\%). Compared with DCM, the ARVC‐LV phenotype was statistically significantly more often characterized by low QRS voltages in limb leads, T‐wave inversion in the inferolateral leads and major ventricular arrhythmias. LV‐LGE was found in all ARVC patients with LV systolic dysfunction and in 69/153 (45\%) of DCM patients. Patients with ARVC and LV systolic dysfunction had a greater amount of LV‐LGE (25\% versus 13\% of LV mass; P{\textless}0.01), mostly localized in the subepicardial LV wall layers. An LV‐LGE ≥20\% had a 100\% specificity for diagnosis of ARVC‐LV phenotype. An inverse correlation between LV ejection fraction and LV‐LGE extent was found in the ARVC‐LV phenotype (r=−0.63; P{\textless}0.01), but not in DCM (r=−0.01; P=0.94).ConclusionsLV involvement in ARVC is common and characterized by clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance features which differ from those seen in DCM. The most distinctive feature of ARVC‐LV phenotype is the large amount of LV‐LGE/fibrosis, which impacts directly and negatively on the LV systolic function.},

	abstract = {Background Regular intensive physical activity is associated with non-pathological changes in cardiac morphology. Differential diagnosis with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) constitutes a frequent problem, especially in athletes showing ventricular arrhythmias with left bundle branch block morphology.
Aim of the study To assess the different clinical and non-invasive instrumental features of the subjects affected by ARVC and by athletes.
Methods Three groups of subjects (40 ARVC patients, 40 athletes and 40 controls, mean age 27 (9) years) were examined with family and personal history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, 24-h ECG, signal-averaged ECG and 2-D and Doppler echocardiography.
Results 12-Lead ECG was abnormal in 62\% of ARVC patients versus 7.5\% of athletes and 2.5\% of controls (p{\textless}0.0001). Ventricular arrhythmias and late potentials were present in 70\% and 55\% of ARVC subjects, respectively (vs 5\% of athletes and 7.5\% of controls, p{\textless}0.0001). Left ventricular parietal wall thickness and left ventricular end-diastolic diameters were significantly higher in athletes. Both athletes and ARVC patients presented a right ventricular (RV) enlargement compared with controls. Moreover, RV outflow tract, measured on parasternal long axis and at the level of aortic root, was significantly larger in ARVC patients (33.6 (4.7) mm vs 29.1 (3.4) mm and 35.6 (6.8) mm vs 30.1 (2.9) mm; p{\textless}0.0001), and RV fractional shortening and ejection fraction were significantly lower in ARVC patients compared with athletes (40 (7.9)\% vs 44 (10)\%; p=0.05 and 52.9 (8)\% vs 59.9 (4.5)\%; p{\textless}0.0001). A thickened moderator band was found to be present in similar percentage in ARVC patients and athletes.
Conclusions An accurate clinical and instrumental non-invasive evaluation including echocardiography as imaging technique allows to distinguish RV alterations typical of ARVC from those detected in athletes as a consequence of intensive physical activity.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Background Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death remains a contentious topic in sport and exercise medicine. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of a standardised criteria tool improves the accuracy of ECG interpretation by physicians screening athletes.
Methods Design: Randomised control trial. Study population: General practitioners with an interest in sports medicine, sports physicians, sports medicine registrars and cardiologists from Australia and New Zealand were eligible to participate. Outcome measures: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and false-positive rates of screening ECG interpretation of athletes. Intervention: A two-page standardised ECG criteria tool was provided to intervention participants. Control participants undertook ‘usual’ interpretation.
Results 62 physicians, with a mean duration of practice of 16 years, were randomised to intervention and control. 10 baseline and 30 postrandomisation athlete ECGs were interpreted by the participants. Intervention participants were more likely to be correct: OR 1.72 (95\% CI 1.31 to 2.27, p{\textless}0.001). Correct ECG interpretation was higher in the intervention group, 88.4\% (95\% CI 85.7\% to 91.2\%), than in the control group, 82.2\% (95\% CI 78.8\% to 85.5\%; p=0.005). Sensitivity was 95\% in the intervention group and 92\% in the control group (p=0.4), with specificity of 86\% and 78\%, respectively (p=0.006). There were 36\% fewer false positives in the intervention group (p=0.006).
Conclusions ECG interpretation in athletes can be improved by using a standardised ECG criteria tool. Use of the tool results in lower false-positive rates; this may have implications for screening recommendations.

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of ECG interpretation in athletes among different physician specialties, with and without use of a standised ECG criteria tool.
Methods Physicians were asked to interpret 40 ECGs (28 normal ECGs from college athletes randomised with 12 abnormal ECGs from individuals with known ciovascular pathology) and classify each ECG as (1) ‘normal or variant – no further evaluation and testing needed’ or (2) ‘abnormal – further evaluation and testing needed.’ After reading the ECGs, participants received a two-page ECG criteria tool to guide interpretation of the ECGs again.
Results A total of 60 physicians participated: 22 primary care (PC) residents, 16 PC attending physicians, 12 sports medicine (SM) physicians and 10 ciologists. At baseline, the total number of ECGs correctly interpreted was PC residents 73\%, PC attendings 73\%, SM physicians 78\% and ciologists 85\%. With use of the ECG criteria tool, all physician groups significantly improved their accuracy (p{\textless}0.0001): PC residents 92\%, PC attendings 90\%, SM physicians 91\% and ciologists 96\%. With use of the ECG criteria tool, specificity improved from 70\% to 91\%, sensitivity improved from 89\% to 94\% and there was no difference comparing ciologists versus all other physicians (p=0.053).
Conclusions Providing standised criteria to assist ECG interpretation in athletes significantly improves the ability to accurately distinguish normal from abnormal findings across physician specialties, even in physicians with little or no experience.},

Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This lecture collection is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. From this lecture collection, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.

	abstract = {The ECG classiﬁcation is a critical task in the early and correct diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Although various models have been developed to tackle the heartbeat classiﬁcation problem, their performance degrades on ECG signals recorded in varied testing conditions due to the distribution discrepancy among different sources of data. In this work, we have developed a multi-source domain generalization model to address the distribution discrepancy problem that occurred when the collection of the data is from multiple sources with various acquisition conditions. We have employed a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) for feature extraction. Further, we exploit the adversarial domain generalization method to overcome probable heterogeneity between the train and test datasets. To increase generalization, we also utilized different augmentation techniques including random ECG pad and crop, adding low-frequency artifacts, and lead dropout. We evaluate our proposed model on cardiac abnormality classiﬁcation based on 12-lead ECG signals associated with ”Classiﬁcation of 12-lead ECGs for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020”. Our method, achieved a challenge validation score of 0.609, and full test score of 0.437 placing us (Sharif AI Team) 5th out of 41 teams in the ﬁnal ofﬁcial ranking.},

The skip connections present in the ResNet allowed the model to train faster and produce better challenge score. We also investigated sixteen other models that included convolution and recurrent neural network based models along with interpretability based attention mechanism as all of them are well suited for time series classiﬁcation problems. The results depicted that the 8 layer ResNet model outperformed other models in terms of challenge score consuming signiﬁcantly less time during the training phase. We preferred batch wise training to avoid having all the data in memory during training thereby alleviating the problem of memory choking.

We calibrated the model on the available 40,000+ ECGs, while organizers tested the model on a private test set. Standard ECG preprocessing was applied. For ECGs related to CAs altering the ECG morphology, multi-lead average P, QRS, and T segments were computed. For signals associated with irregular rhythms, time dependent features were computed. The ensemble model comprised of: i) three DNNs to classify morphology-related CAs. ii) a fully connected neural network to classify irregular rhythm; and iii) a thresholdbased classiﬁer for premature ventricular beat detection. The organizers designed a score for ranking the models. The ensemble model proposed by our team “BiSP Lab” reached the 40th position, and obtained a score of -0.179 on the private test set. Despite the low performance obtained on the private test set, our ensemble model showed potential for classiﬁcation of CAs from ECGs.},

The method uses 1D-CNNs stacked in parallel with each CNN tuned to identify one of the classes. Each of these CNNs have same architecture comprising of convolutional layers, batch normalizations, activation layers and a dense layer with added regularizations and dropouts. The class dependent threshold gives the beneﬁt of optimizing the model for each of the class individually without the need of training separate models for each category.

Detector of QRS complexes, T-waves and P-waves including detection of their boundaries was designed. Then, the most common morphology of the QRS was found in each record. All these QRS were averaged. Features were extracted from the averaged QRS and from intervals between detected points. Appropriate features and rules were set using classification trees.
Results: Our approach achieved a challenge validation score of 0.435, and full test score of 0.354, placing us 11 out of 41 in the official ranking.
Conclusion: The advantage of our algorithm is easy interpretation. It is obvious according to which features algorithm decided and what thresholds were set.},

	abstract = {Identifying arrhythmias from electrocardiogram(ECG) signals remains an intractable challenge. This study aims to develop an effective and non-invasive approach to realize the recognition of arrhythmias based on 12-lead ECG for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge2020. To this end, we propose a deep learningbased diagnosis approach, called EASTNet which captures the characteristics of cardiac abnormalities and correlation between heartbeats sampled randomly from 12-lead ECG records by a 34-layer 1D-deep squeezeand-excitation network. Experimenting in the multi-label arrhythmia classification task, our team, EASTBLUE, was unable to rank and score in the hidden validation and test sets, but achieved diagnostic performance with 0.7030 ± 0.0090 metric score using 5-fold crossvalidation on the training set. We also investigate the effect of beat sampling on diagnostic performance, and find that the beat sampling plays a role in data augmentation that effectively alleviates network overfitting. These results demonstrate that our approach has good potential application prospects in clinical practice, especially in the auxiliary diagnosis of abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We describe the creation of a deep neural network architecture to classify cardiac abnormality from 12 lead ECGs. The model was created by the team “between a ROC and a heart place” for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020.
Methods: ECGs were downsampled to 257 Hz and then set to a consistent duration by randomly clipping or zeropadding the signal to 4096 samples. To learn effective features, we created a modiﬁed ResNet with larger kernel sizes that models long-term dependencies. We embedded a Squeeze-And-Excitation layer into the modiﬁed ResNet to learn the importance of each lead, adaptively. A simple constrained grid-search was applied to deal with class imbalance.
Results: Using the bespoke weighted accuracy metric, we achieved a 5-fold cross-validation score of 0.684, sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 0.758 and 0.969, respectively. We scored 0.520 on the full test data, and ranked 2nd out of the 41 teams that participated in the challenge.
Conclusion: The proposed prediction model performed well on the validation and hidden test data. Such models may be potentially used for ECG screening or diagnosis.},

Therefore, developing an objective and efficient computeraided tool for diagnosis of heart disease has become a promising research topic. In this paper, we design a multiscale shared convolution kernel model. In this model, two paths are designed to extract the features of electrocardiogram(ECG). The two paths have different convolution kernel sizes, which are 3×1 and 5×1, respectively. Such multi-scale design enables the network to obtain different receptive fields and capture information at different scales, which significantly improves the classification effect. And squeeze-and-excitation networks (SE-Net) are added to every path of the model. The attention mechanism of SE-Net learns feature weights according to loss, which makes the effective feature maps have large weights and the ineffective or low-effect feature maps have small weights.

Methods necessary to detect pre-existing cardiac abnormalities are discussed to formulate a PPSP for the Medical Commission of the IOC.ResultsSCD occurred in 1101 (1966?2004) reported cases in athletes under 35 years, 50\% had congenital anatomical heart disease and cardiomyopathies and 10\% had early-onset atherosclerotic heart disease. Forty percent occurred in athletes under 18 years, 33\% under 16 years; the female/male ratio was 1/9. SCD was reported in almost all sports; most frequently involved were soccer (30\%), basketball (25\%) and running (15\%). The PPSP were of varying quality and content. The IOC consensus meeting accepted the proposed Lausanne Recommendations based on this research and expert opinions (http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en\_report\_886.pdf).ConclusionSCD occurs more frequently in young athletes, even those under the age of 18 years, than expected and is predominantly caused by pre-existing congenital cardiac abnormalities. Premature atherosclerotic disease forms another important cause in these young adults. A generally acceptable PPSP has been achieved by the IOC's acceptance of the Lausanne Recommendations.},

	abstract = {Multi-label learning deals with problems where each example is represented by a single instance while being associated with multiple class labels simultaneously. Binary relevance is arguably the most intuitive solution for learning from multi-label examples. It works by decomposing the multi-label learning task into a number of independent binary learning tasks (one per class label). In view of its potential weakness in ignoring correlations between labels, many correlation-enabling extensions to binary relevance have been proposed in the past decade. In this paper, we aim to review the state of the art of binary relevance from three perspectives. First, basic settings for multi-label learning and binary relevance solutions are briefly summarized. Second, representative strategies to provide binary relevancewith label correlation exploitation abilities are discussed. Third, some of our recent studies on binary relevance aimed at issues other than label correlation exploitation are introduced. As a conclusion, we provide suggestions on future research directions.},

	abstract = {This research investigated the effect of computer-assisted test interpretation (CATI) on physicians' readings of electrocardiograms (ECGs). The authors used an experimental method based on direct observations of 22 cardiologists, each reading 80 ECGs, for a total of 1,760 (of which 1,745 were used in the study). There were 40 sets of clini cally-matched pairs of ECGs, one with CATI and one without. Reading time was ob served and interpretation accuracy was measured by criterion-referenced aggregate scoring. To control for potential biases, the findings were subjected to multivariate analyses using ordinary least-squares regressions. The impact of CATI on cardiolo gists' readings of ECGs is demonstrably beneficial: the main empirical conclusion of this study is that, compared with conventional interpretation, the use of computer- assisted interpretation of ECGs cuts physician time by an average of 28\% and signif icantly improves the concordance of the physician's interpretation with the expert benchmark, without increasing the false-positive rate. Moreover, CATI is the most ac curate and saves the most time when the ECGs have many unambiguous diagnoses. Given that computers alone cannot perform the task of cardiovascular diagnosis, and that cardiologists' ECG interpretations are greatly enhanced by ubiquitous CATI tech nology, it appears that the best approach is one that combines person and machine. Key words: electrocardiogram interpretation; computer-assisted test interpretation; physician decision making; diagnostic concordance; technology utilization. (Med Decis Making 1997;17:80-86)},

The main aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of abnormal ECG findings in male professional soccer players according to European Society of Cardiology's (ESC) recommendations and the Seattle criteria, and to assess the need for echocardiography. ECGs from 587 of 595 (99\%) players were recorded with ClickECG, and measurements were derived with visually adjusted on-screen calipers on the computer-based averaged PQRST complex. Echocardiographic recordings were performed with Vivid 7/i and categorized according to reference values for athlete's heart. After the initial screening, 32 (5.5\%) players were recommended for follow-up. The prevalence of abnormal ECGs was 29.3\% vs 11.2\% according to the ESC's recommendations and the Seattle criteria, respectively. None of the players with abnormal ECGs only according to the ESC's recommendations had abnormal echocardiograms. Echocardiography alone detected one player with abnormalities (athlete's heart). The Seattle criteria reduced the number of athletes with abnormal ECGs considerably compared with the ESC recommendations. Based on echocardiographic evaluations, this increased the specificity of the Seattle criteria, without increasing the number of false-negative ECGs. The need for mandatory echocardiography in soccer players seems limited.},

Differentiating between the two entities is prudent since BAs exhibit a higher prevalence of exercise-related sudden death from HCM compared with white athletes (WAs).Between 1996 and 2010, 904 BAs underwent serial cardiac evaluations including ECG and echocardiography. Athletes exhibiting T-wave inversions were investigated further for HCM. Results were compared with 1819 WAs, 119 black controls (BCs), and 52 black HCM patients. Athletes were followed up for 69.7 ± 29.6 months. T-wave inversions were present in 82.7\% HCM patients, 22.8\% BAs, 10.1\% BCs, and 3.7\% WAs. In athletes, the major determinant of T-wave inversions was black ethnicity. T-wave inversions in BAs (12.7\%) were predominantly confined to contiguous anterior leads (V1–V4). Only 4.1\% of BAs exhibited T-wave inversions in the lateral leads. In contrast, both BCs and HCM patients exhibited lower prevalence of T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4 (4.2 and 3.8\%, respectively) with most T-wave inversions in HCM patients (76.9\%) involving the lateral leads. During follow-up one BA survived cardiac arrest and two athletes (one BA, one WA) were diagnosed with HCM. All three exhibited T-wave inversions in the lateral leads.T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4 appear to represent an ethnic variant of ‘athlete's heart’. Conversely, T-wave inversions in the lateral leads may represent the initial expression of underlying cardiomyopathy and merit further evaluation and regular surveillance.},

METHODS: A total of 1000 (73\% male) junior elite athletes (mean (SD) age 15.7 (1.4) years (range 14-18); mean (SD) body surface area 1.73 (0.17) m2 (range 1.09-2.25)) and 300 non-athletic controls matched for gender, age, and body surface area had a 12 lead ECG examination. RESULTS: Athletes had a significantly higher prevalence of sinus bradycardia (80\% v 19\%; p{\textless}0.0001) and sinus arrhythmia (52\% v 9\%; p{\textless}0.0001) than non-athletes. The PR interval, QRS, and QT duration were more prolonged in athletes than non-athletes (153 (20) v 140 (18) milliseconds (p{\textless}0.0001), 92 (12) v 89 (7) milliseconds (p{\textless}0.0001), and 391 (27) v 379 (29) milliseconds (p = 0.002) respectively). The Sokolow voltage criterion for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the Romhilt-Estes points score for LVH was more common in athletes (45\% v 23\% (p{\textless}0.0001) and 10\% v 0\% (p{\textless}0.0001) respectively), as were criteria for left and right atrial enlargement (14\% v 1.2\% and 16\% v 2\% respectively). None of the athletes with voltage criteria for LVH had left axis deviation, ST segment depression, deep T wave inversion, or pathological Q waves. ST segment elevation was more common in athletes than non-athletes (43\% v 24\%; p{\textless}0.0001). Minor T wave inversion (less than -0.2 mV) in V2 and V3 was present in 4\% of athletes and non-athletes. Minor T wave inversion elsewhere was absent in non-athletes and present in 0.4\% of athletes. CONCLUSIONS: ECG changes in junior elite athletes are not dissimilar to those in senior athletes. Isolated Sokolow voltage criterion for LVH is common; however, associated abnormalities that indicate pathological hypertrophy are absent. Minor T wave inversions in leads other than V2 and V3 may be present in athletes and non-athletes less than 16 but should be an indication for further investigation in older athletes.},

Common methods of de-identification implemented to enable the sharing of data are sometimes inadequate to protect the individuals contained in the data. For our research, we investigate the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic medical time series data which can be used without concerns over privacy. The aim is to generate synthetic ECG signals representative of normal ECG waveforms. GANs have been used successfully to generate good quality synthetic time series and have been shown to prevent re-identification of individual records. In this work, a range of GAN architectures are developed to generate synthetic sine waves and synthetic ECG. Two evaluation metrics are then used to quantitatively assess how suitable the synthetic data is for real world applications such as clinical training and data analysis. Finally, we discuss the privacy concerns associated with sharing synthetic data produced by GANs and test their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack. For the first time we both quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that GAN architecture can successfully generate time series signals that are not only structurally similar to the training sets but also diverse in nature across generated samples. We also report on their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack, protecting the privacy of the training set.},

	isbn = {978-3-030-37446-4},
	abstract = {Machine learning based predictive models have been used in different areas of everyday life for decades. However, with the recent availability of big data, new ways emerge on how to interpret the decisions of machine learning models. In addition to global interpretation focusing on the general prediction model decisions, this paper emphasizes the importance of local interpretation of predictions. Local interpretation focuses on specifics of each individual and provides explanations that can lead to a better understanding of the feature contribution in smaller groups of individuals that are often overlooked by the global interpretation techniques. In this paper, three machine learning based prediction models were compared: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF) and Generalized linear model with regularization (GLM). No significant differences in prediction performance, measured by mean average error, were detected: GLM: 0.573 (0.569 − 0.577); GBM: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583); RF: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583). Similar to other studies that used prediction models for screening in type 2 diabetes mellitus, we found a strong contribution of features like age, gender and BMI on the global interpretation level. On the other hand, local interpretation technique discovered some features like depression, smoking status or physical activity that can be influential in specific groups of patients. This study outlines the prospects of using local interpretation techniques to improve the interpretability of prediction models in the era of personalized healthcare. At the same time, we try to warn the users and developers of prediction models that prediction performance should not be the only criteria for model selection.},

Shapley values is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose. The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable theoretical properties, and can in principle handle any predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the features are independent, which may give very wrong explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several examples of linear and non-linear models with various degrees of feature dependence, where our method gives more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values. We also propose a method for aggregating individual Shapley values, such that the prediction can be explained by groups of dependent variables.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the causes of software misinterpretation of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) compared to clinically identified STEMI to identify opportunities to improve prehospital STEMI identification. Methods: We compared ECGs acquired from July 2011 through June 2012 using the LIFEPAK 15 on adult patients transported by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Cases included patients ≥18 years who received a prehospital ECG. Software interpretation of the ECG (STEMI or not) was compared with data in the regional EMS registry to classify the interpretation as true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), or false negative (FN). For cases where classification was not possible using registry data, 3 blinded cardiologists interpreted the ECG. Each discordance was subsequently reviewed to determine the likely cause of misclassification. The cardiologists independently reviewed a sample of these discordant ECGs and the causes of misclassification were updated in an iterative fashion. Results: Of 44,611 cases, 50\% were male (median age 65; inter-quartile range 52–80). Cases were classified as 482 (1.1\%) TP, 711 (1.6\%) FP, 43371 (97.2\%) TN, and 47 (0.11\%) FN. Of the 711 classified as FP, 126 (18\%) were considered appropriate for, though did not undergo, emergent coronary angiography, because the ECG showed definite (52 cases) or borderline (65 cases) ischemic ST elevation, a STEMI equivalent (5 cases) or ST-elevation due to vasospasm (4 cases). The sensitivity was 92.8\% [95\% CI 90.6, 94.7\%] and the specificity 98.7\% [95\% CI 98.6, 98.8\%]. The leading causes of FP were ECG artifact (20\%), early repolarization (16\%), probable pericarditis/myocarditis (13\%), indeterminate (12\%), left ventricular hypertrophy (8\%), and right bundle branch block (5\%). There were 18 additional reasons for FP interpretation ({\textless}4\% each). The leading causes of FN were borderline ST-segment elevations less than the algorithm threshold (40\%) and tall T waves reducing the ST/T ratio below threshold (15\%). There were 11 additional reasons for FN interpretation occurring ≤3 times each. Conclusion: The leading causes of FP automated interpretation of STEMI were ECG artifact and non-ischemic causes of ST-segment elevation. FN were rare and were related to ST-segment elevation or ST/T ratio that did not meet the software algorithm threshold.},

	abstract = {Background There is accumulating evidence that thrombolytic therapy is underused among eligible patients with acute myocardial infarction. We sought to determine whether potential errors in electrocardiographic diagnosis might be a contributing factor. Methods Seventy-five electrocardiograms were interpreted on 2 separate occasions by 3 cardiologists. Two criteria were compared for thrombolysis eligibility: (1) measurement of ≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in 2 contiguous leads (measured) and (2) criterion 1 plus the subjective opinion that the changes represented acute transmural injury (interpretive). The results were compared with computerized interpretations by the Marquette 12SL system. Results Raw agreement and agreement corrected for chance between raters for both criteria were excellent and tended to be better for interpretive compared with measured criteria (κ = 0.89 vs 0.78, respectively). Strict reliance on measured electrocardiographic criteria alone would have resulted in overuse of thrombolysis among all 3 raters. Based on the consensus opinion, the absolute overuse of thrombolysis would have been approximately 15\% (P {\textless}.0034). The computer algorithm had a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity of 61.5\%. Reliance on the computerized interpretation alone would have lead to underuse of thrombolytic therapy compared with consensus opinion (21.3\% vs 34.6\%; P {\textless}.005). Conclusion Agreement for suspected acute myocardial infarction tended to be better when the appearance of the ST segments was added to measurable ST elevation criteria. Strict reliance on measurable criteria may lead to the inappropriate overuse of thrombolysis. Although the Marquette 12SL system has excellent specificity, it has poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of thrombolysis-eligible AMI. Reliance on computerized electrocardiographic interpretation would lead to the inappropriate underuse of thrombolytic therapy in situations in which qualifying electrocardiographic criteria are actually met.

The body surface map (BSM) improves AMI detection but is limited by its interpretation by inexperienced medical staff. To facilitate interpretation, an automated BSM algorithm was developed and is evaluated in this study. One hundred three patients with ischemic-type chest pain were recruited for this study from December 2001 to April 2002. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (Marquette Mac 5K) and BSM (PRIME-ECG) were recorded at initial presentation, and cardiac troponin I and/or creatine kinase-MB levels measured at 12 hours after symptom onset. The admitting physician’s 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) interpretation, 12-lead ECG algorithm (Marquette 12 SL V233) diagnosis, and BSM algorithm diagnosis were documented for each patient. AMI, defined by elevation of troponin I to {\textgreater}1 μg/L and/or creatine kinase-MB to {\textgreater}25U/L, occurred in 53 patients. The admitting physician diagnosed 24 patients with AMI (sensitivity 45\%, specificity 94\%), the 12-lead ECG algorithm diagnosed 17 patients with AMI (sensitivity 32\%, specificity 98\%), and the BSM algorithm diagnosed 34 patients with AMI (sensitivity 64\%, specificity 94\%). The BSM algorithm improved the diagnostic sensitivity by 2.0 (p {\textless}0.001) and 1.4 (p = 0.002) compared with the 12-lead ECG algorithm or the admitting physician, respectively. There was no significant difference in specificity. Thus, the BSM algorithm improves detection of AMI compared with the 12-lead ECG algorithm or physician’s 12-lead ECG interpretation.},

We compared the ECGs of nonobvious ("subtle") anterior STEMI with emergency department noncardiac chest pain patients with early repolarization. ST-segment elevation at the J point and 60 ms after the J point, T-wave amplitude, R-wave amplitude, QTc, upward concavity, J-wave notching, and T waves in V1 and V6 were measured.

Computerized QTc was also significantly longer with STEMI versus early repolarization. T-wave amplitude did not differ significantly between the groups, such that the T-wave amplitude$_{\textrm{avg}}$/R-wave amplitude$_{\textrm{avg}}$ difference was entirely due to the difference in R-wave amplitude. An ECG criterion based on 3 measurements (R-wave amplitude in lead V4, ST-segment elevation 60 ms after J-point in lead V3, and QTc) was derived and validated for differentiating STEMI versus early repolarization, such that if the value of the equation ([1.196 x ST-segment elevation 60 ms after the J point in lead V3 in mm]+[0.059 x QTc in ms]–[0.326 x R-wave amplitude in lead V4 in mm]) is greater than 23.4 predicted STEMI and if less than or equal to 23.4, it predicted early repolarization in both groups, with overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 79, 91), 91\% (95\% CI 85, 95), and 88\% (95\% CI 84, 92), respectively, with positive likelihood ratio 9.2 (95\% CI 8.5 to 10) and negative likelihood ratio 0.1 (95\% CI 0.08 to 0.3).

	abstract = {Introduction
Interpreting repolarization changes in the electrocardiograms of athletes present a clinical challenge.
Aim
Assessment of cardiac repolarization by T-wave morphology using the Morphology Combination Score (MCS), and evaluate how this quantitative description of T-wave morphology was influenced by the sport performed.
Materials and methods
Digital electrocardiograms of 469 young elite athletes were analyzed for T-wave asymmetry, flatness and notching, and combined in the MCS. Athletes {\textgreater}22years were compared to a sex-and age matched control group from the general population (N=198).
Results
MCS increased with increasing endurance component of the sport performed ranging from 0.79±0.15 (low) to 0.92±0.21 (high) (p{\textless}0.0001). All subcomponents of MCS were increased compared to controls. MCS was unrelated to age, sex and ECG findings of the athlete's heart.
Conclusion
This study suggests that sport induces repolarization changes detected by T-wave morphology, and a greater level of changes is seen in athletes from high endurance sports.},

This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice.METHODS AND RESULTSWe developed a 37‐layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free‐text physician‐annotated 12‐lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12‐lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category‐specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3\% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.92–0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.79–0.87).CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrates that an end‐to‐end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free‐text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12‐lead ECGs. When further fine‐tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning–based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.},

Aims To compare the prevalence of abnormal ECGs and test the correlation between visual and computer-based measurements.
Methods In a preparticipation cardiac screening examination of 595 male professional soccer players aged 18–38 years, ECGs were categorised according to the European Society of Cardiology's (ESC) recommendations and the Seattle criteria, respectively. Visual measurements were conducted with callipers on-screen on the averaged PQRST complex in each lead, calculated by the trimmed mean. Computer-based measurements were derived from the medium beat. Heart rhythm and conduction were scored visually by a cardiologist. Categorical variables were compared by κ statistics (K) and continuous variables by intraclass correlation.
Results ECGs of good quality were available from 579 players. According to the ESC's recommendations and Seattle criteria, respectively, ECGs were categorised as abnormal in 171 (29.5\%) vs 64 (11.1\%) players after visual assessment, and in 293 (50.6\%; K=0.395) vs 127 (21.9\%; K=0.564) after computer-based measurements. Intraclass correlation was very good for measurements of R and S wave amplitudes and moderate to very good for intervals. K was very good for pathological Q wave amplitudes and moderate for T wave inversions.
Conclusions Abnormal ECGs were more than twice as common after computer-based than after visual measurements. Such a difference will markedly influence the number of athletes who need further examinations. Reference values may need adjustments dependent on measurement methods.},

	abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterised by left ventricular dilation that is associated with systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction and impaired right ventricular function can develop. Affected individuals are at risk of left or right ventricular failure, or both. Heart failure symptoms can be exercise-induced or persistent at rest. Many patients are asymptomatic. Chronically treated patients sometimes present acutely with decompensated heart failure. Other life-threatening risks are ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block, syncope, and sudden death. Genetic inheritance arises in 30–48\% of patients, and inflammatory disorders such as myocarditis or toxic effects from medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs also result in dilated cardiomyopathy. Genes that cause dilated cardiomyopathy generally encode cytoskeletal and sarcomeric (contractile apparatus) proteins, although disturbance of calcium homeostasis also seems to be important. In children, disrupted mitochondrial function and metabolic abnormalities have a causal role. Treatments focus on improvement of cardiac efficiency and reduction of mechanical stress. Arrhythmia therapy and prevention of sudden death continue to be mainstays of treatment. Despite progress over the past 10 years, outcomes need to be improved.},

	abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant DL techniques based on these DL approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, DL approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on DL using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models.},

	abstract = {Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is often the first manifestation of unrecognised cardiac disease. ECG abnormalities encountered in primary care settings may be warning signs of OHCA.
Objective We examined the association between common ECG abnormalities and OHCA in a primary care setting.
Methods We cross-linked individuals who had an ECG recording between 2001 and 2011 in a primary care setting with the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry and identified OHCAs of presumed cardiac cause.
Results A total of 326 227 individuals were included and 2667 (0,8\%) suffered an OHCA. In Cox regression analyses, adjusted for age and sex, the following ECG findings were strongly associated with OHCA: ST-depression without concomitant atrial fibrillation (HR 2.79; 95\% CI 2.45 to 3.18), left bundle branch block (LBBB; HR 3.44; 95\% CI 2.85 to 4.14) and non-specific intraventricular block (NSIB; HR 3.15; 95\% CI 2.58 to 3.83). Also associated with OHCA were atrial fibrillation (HR 1.89; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.18), Q-wave (HR 1.75; 95\% CI 1.57 to 1.95), Cornell and Sokolow-Lyon criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (HR 1.56; 95\% CI 1.33 to 1.82 and HR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.45, respectively), ST-elevation (HR 1.40; 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.54) and right bundle branch block (HR 1.29; 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.54). The association between ST-depression and OHCA diminished with concomitant atrial fibrillation (HR 1.79; 95\% CI 1.42 to 2.24, p {\textless} 0.01 for interaction). Among patients suffering from OHCA, without a known cardiac disease at the time of the cardiac arrest, 14.2 \% had LBBB, NSIB or ST-depression.
Conclusions Several common ECG findings obtained from a primary care setting are associated with OHCA.},

	abstract = {The importance of ECG classification is very high now due to many current medical applications where this problem can be stated. Currently, there are many machine learning (ML) solutions which can be used for analyzing and classifying ECG data. However, the main disadvantages of these ML results is use of heuristic hand-crafted or engineered features with shallow feature learning architectures. The problem relies in the possibility not to find most appropriate features which will give high classification accuracy in this ECG problem. One of the proposing solution is to use deep learning architectures where first layers of convolutional neurons behave as feature extractors and in the end some fully-connected (FCN) layers are used for making final decision about ECG classes. In this work the deep learning architecture with 1D convolutional layers and FCN layers for ECG classification is presented and some classification results are showed.},

The 12-lead electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data from 510 competitive athletes were analyzed. Compared to the 51 age-, sport type-, and gender-matched athletes with normal 12-lead electrocardiographic QRS complex duration, the 44 athletes with IRBBB (9\%) and 13 with CRBBB (3\%) had larger right ventricular (RV) dimensions, as measured by the basal RV end-diastolic diameter (CRBBB 43 ± 3 mm, IRBBB 38 ± 6 mm, normal QRS complex 35 ± 4 mm, p {\textless}0.001) and RV end-diastolic area (CRBBB 33 ± 5, IRBBB 27 ± 7, and normal QRS complex 23 ± 3 cm$^{\textrm{2}}$; p {\textless}0.001). Athletes with CRBBB also had a relative reduction in the RV systolic function at rest as assessed by the RV fractional area change and peak systolic tissue velocity. Finally, QRS prolongation was associated with parallel increases in interventricular dyssynchrony (basal RV to basal lateral left ventricular peak systolic tissue velocity time difference: CRBBB 112 ± 15, IRBBB 73 ± 33, normal QRS complex 43 ± 39 ms, p {\textless}0.001). Despite these findings, no athlete with CRBBB or IRBBB was found to have pathologic structural cardiac disease. In conclusion, among trained athletes, CRBBB and IRBBB appear to be markers of a structural and physiological cardiac remodeling triad characterized by RV dilation, a relative reduction in the RV systolic function at rest, and interventricular dyssynchrony.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Patients with a substantial risk of sudden death usually need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Although ICDs effectively end most episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and decrease mortality in specific populations of patients, they have inherent risks and limitations. Generally, antiarrhythmic drugs do not provide sufficient protection from sudden death, but do have a role in reducing arrhythmias that cause symptoms. Catheter ablation is likewise important for reducing the frequency of spontaneous arrhythmias and is curative for some patients, usually those with idiopathic arrhythmias and no heart disease. Arrhythmia surgery is now infrequent, offered by only a few specialised centres for refractory arrhythmias. Advances in understanding of genetic arrhythmia syndromes and in technology for mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias, and enhanced algorithms in implantable devices for rhythm management, have contributed to improved outcomes.},

	abstract = {Atrial tachycardia is an arrhythmia with electrical impulses originating within the atria. Atrial tachycardia can be a result of one or a combination of the mechanisms leading to arrhythmia: automatic, triggered activity, or reentry. In some cases, the mechanism remains undetermined.[1] Electrophysiologic features may overlap if there is a small reentrant circuit, as in micro-reentry. It is useful to categorize atrial tachycardia in two broad groups: macroreentrant or focal. The prototypic macroreentrant atrial tachycardia is an atrial flutter. Typical atrial flutter arises from the right atrium in a circuit bound anteriorly by the tricuspid annulus and posteriorly by the crista terminalis and Eustachian ridge.[2] The electrical activity can travel in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction in this circuit.  Atrial flutter is a complex arrhythmia with different management than focal atrial tachycardias. As such, the focus of this activity will be on focal atrial tachycardia (FAT).},

	abstract = {The heart has an electrical system that allows it to contract and pump blood through the body in a coordinated rhythm. Regular heartbeats occur when specialized cells in the right atrium of the heart, called the sinoatrial (SA) node, conduct an electrical signal down to the atrioventricular (AV) node which is another set of specialized cells. This electrical signal then works its way down the bundle of His and Purkinje fibers to the heart ventricles. The result is the contraction of the ventricles and pumping of blood from the heart out to the body's arteries.[1] During a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), the heartbeat is initiated by the Purkinje fibers rather than the SA node. Given that a PVC occurs before a regular heartbeat, there is a pause before the next regular heartbeat.[2] PVCs can occur in isolation or in repeated patterns. Two consecutive PVCs are termed doublets while three consecutive PVCs are named triplets. It is important to note that three or more consecutive PVCs are classified as ventricular tachycardia. If the PVCs continuously alternate with a regular sinus beat, the patient is in bigeminy.[3] Likewise, if every third heartbeat is a PVC, then it is named trigeminy.  PVCs present as heart palpitations in most patients. They are usually benign and do not require treatment.},

A delay in conduction in this system results in an atrioventricular conduction block or a prolongation of the PR interval on ECG. Conduction blocks are classified as either first-degree block, second-degree block, or third-degree block. The second-degree atrioventricular block is the focus of this activity. There are two types of second-degree atrioventricular blocks: Mobitz type I, also known as, Wenckebach and Mobitz type II.[1][2][3][4][5] In general, patients with second degree AV block may have no symptoms or may experience symptoms like syncope and lightheadedness.The second degree heart block may be temporary or permanent, depending on the impairment of the conduction system.

Three patients had anterior wall infarction; all developed acute right bundle-branch block and two also showed a left anterior hemiblock one to four hours prior to onset of second-degree atrioventricular block. The fourth patient had an old anteroseptal infarction and chronic right bundle-branch block and left anterior hemiblock; he developed second-degree atrioventricular block following an acute lateroposterior infarction. His bundle electrograms were obtained during the insertion of a temporary ventricular pacemaker within the first 24 hours of onset of chest pain. A second His bundle electrogram was obtained during removal of the temporary pacemaker 7 to 14 days after the first recording. In all cases the block was localized in the His-Purkinje system. In three patients the first His bundle recording showed second-degree atrioventricular block with minimal increment of delay in conduction (3 to 10 msec) prior to the blocked beat (equivalent of Mobitz type 2 block). The second His bundle electrogram showed the development of significant increment of delay in conduction (35 to 210 msec) prior to block (equivalent of Wenckebach conduction). The fourth patient illustrated the reverse order of the observations seen in the other three. Three patients showed resumption of 1:1 atrioventricular conduction; however, when one patient was challenged with rapid atrial pacing, he developed repetitive block in the His-Purkinje system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We assessed the impact of the ESC criteria, the newly published Seattle criteria, and a group of proposed refined criteria in a large cohort of black athletes (BAs) and WAs.Methods and Results—Between 2000 and 2012, 1208 BAs were evaluated with history, examination, 12-lead ECG, and further investigations as appropriate. ECGs were retrospectively analyzed according to the ESC recommendations, Seattle criteria, and proposed refined criteria which exclude several specific ECG patterns when present in isolation. All 3 criteria were also applied to 4297 WAs and 103 young athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ESC recommendations raised suspicion of a cardiac abnormality in 40.4\% of BAs and 16.2\% of WAs. The Seattle criteria reduced abnormal ECGs to 18.4\% in BAs and 7.1\% in WAs. The refined criteria further reduced abnormal ECGs to 11.5\% in BAs and 5.3\% in WAs. All 3 criteria identified 98.1\% of athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Compared with ESC recommendations, the refined criteria improved specificity from 40.3\% to 84.2\% in BAs and from 73.8\% to 94.1\% in WAs without compromising the sensitivity of the ECG in detecting pathology.Conclusion—Refinement of current ECG screening criteria has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of false-positive ECGs in athletes, particularly BAs.},

	abstract = {ECG heartbeat classification plays a vital role in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Traditional heartbeat classification methods rely on handcrafted features and often fail to learn potentially abstract patterns, while current deep learning based methods usually consist of complex convolutional and recursive structures. In this paper, considering the time sequence property of ECG signals, we propose a novel heartbeat classification method based on Transformer, a sequence-to-sequence model with a relatively simple architecture and higher degree of parallelism. To adapt Transformer to our problem, we use only the encoder part of the model for that ECG signals do not have translation signals. We also replace the dropout layers with batch normalization layers, considering our small-size feature space and the natural differences among patients. Further, we fuse handcrafted temporal features with the features learnt by Transformer to better capture rhythmic patterns in ECG signals. We have conducted extensive experiments on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database using both the original dataset and an augmented dataset with more balanced data. The results show that our model can achieve 99.62\% accuracy, 95.09\% precision and 94.12\% sensitivity on the original dataset and 99.87\% accuracy, 99.74\% precision and 99.74\% sensitivity on the augmented dataset. Besides, we have performed multiple experiments against state-of-the-art methods using their assessment strategies. Experimental results indicate that our model can achieve better performance under most circumstances.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether non-specific anomalies such as axis deviation and atrial enlargement in isolation require further assessment in highly trained young athletes.Between 2003 and 2011, 2533 athletes aged 14–35 years were investigated with 12-lead ECG and echocardiography. Electrocardiograms were analysed for non-training-related (Group 2) changes according to the 2010 ESC guidelines. Results were compared with 9997 asymptomatic controls. Of the 2533 athletes, 329 (13\%) showed Group 2 ECG changes. Isolated axis deviation and isolated atrial enlargement comprised 42.6\% of all Group 2 changes. Athletes revealed a slightly higher prevalence of these anomalies compared with controls (5.5 vs. 4.4\%; P = 0.023). Echocardiographic evaluation of athletes and controls with isolated axis deviation or atrial enlargement (n = 579) failed to identify any major structural or functional abnormalities. Exclusion of axis deviation or atrial enlargement reduced the false positive rate from 13 to 7.5\% and improved specificity from 90 to 94\% with a minimal reduction in sensitivity (91–89.5\%).Isolated axis deviation and atrial enlargement comprise a high burden of Group 2 changes in athletes and do not predict underlying structural cardiac disease. Exclusion of these anomalies from current ESC guidelines would improve specificity and cost-effectiveness of pre-participation screening with ECG.},

Echocardiograms are considered the gold-standard for diagnosis, but given their wider access and lower economic cost, electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from further investigation. This study investigates the utility of ECG criteria to diagnose LAE in pediatric patients. A retrospective chart review (n = 492) was conducted in patients whose echocardiograms demonstrated LAE by left atrial indexed diameter z-score ≥2.0 and/or increased left atrial to aortic root ratio at various cutoffs (≥1.4, ≥1.6, ≥1.8).

Sensitivity, specificity, Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ), and ROC curves were calculated. A combination of P mitrale ≥40 msec and terminal negative P wave deflection in lead V1 {\textgreater} 40 msec yielded the greatest agreement (κ = 0.221, 95\%CI 0.060–0.382), but all ECG criteria used to diagnose LAE had poor diagnostic value (AUC {\textless} 0.60). The present ECG criteria should not be used to diagnose LAE in the absence of an echocardiogram and findings should be considered in the context of clinical symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background The juvenile ECG pattern is defined as T wave inversion (TWI) in 2 contiguous anterior leads (V1 to V3) in individuals{\textless}16 years of age. This is due to electrical predominance of the right ventricle in infancy which gradually resolves with normalisation of the T waves post-puberty. Anterior TWI, however, is also the hallmark of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The recent international guidelines for electrocardiographic (ECG) interpretation in athletes do not recommend further evaluation of the juvenile ECG pattern in the absence of symptoms or significant family history of cardiac disease.
Purpose To assess the prevalence of the juvenile ECG pattern in a large, unselected population of adolescents and assess its evolution through puberty.
Methods Between 2011 and 2013, 7162 individuals between the ages of 13–16 years underwent voluntary cardiac screening with a health questionnaire and ECG. Individuals with the juvenile ECG pattern were invited for repeat ECG on an annual basis. ECGs from both the primary and final consultation were evaluated by two investigators for the presence of the juvenile pattern. Individuals with persistent TWI beyond V2 aged 16 years were referred for comprehensive evaluation.
Results A juvenile ECG pattern was observed in 430 (6\%) individuals. The presence of a juvenile ECG pattern was more common in females (11\% of females) than males (5\% of males) (p{\textless}0.0001). The overall prevalence of the juvenile pattern reduced with increasing age (figure 1); this was the case for both TWI limited to leads V1-V2 and TWI extending beyond V2 (Figure 1). During a mean follow-up of 1.8±0.98 years, 162 subjects attended for a repeat ECG. 158 (98\%) of these individuals demonstrated resolution of the juvenile pattern. The remaining 4 cases underwent further evaluation and follow-up. After a period of 5.1±0.3 years, none of these individuals demonstrated any phenotypic features of cardiomyopathy.{\textless}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure1" src="https://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/104/Suppl\_6/A63.1/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="267"/{\textgreater}Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint Abstract 71 Figure 1
Conclusion The prevalence of the juvenile pattern in the general population between 13–16 years is 6\%. It is more common in females and reduces significantly with age. The vast majority (98\%) of juvenile ECGs resolve by the age of 16 years. Persistence of the juvenile ECG pattern over the 16 years is rare and should be evaluated further for cardiomyopathy.},

	abstract = {Pre-participation cardiovascular screening of young athletes may prevent sports-related sudden cardiac deaths. Recognition of physiological electrocardiography (ECG) changes in healthy athletes has improved the specificity of screening while maintaining sensitivity for disease. The study objective was to determine the clinical significance of electrocardiographic right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) in athletes.Between 2010 and 2012, 868 subjects aged 14–35 years (68.8\% male) were assessed using ECG and echocardiography (athletes; n = 627, sedentary controls; n = 241). Results were compared against patients with established right ventricular (RV) pathology (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, n = 68; pulmonary hypertension, n = 30). Sokolow-Lyon RVH (R[V1]+S[V5orV6] \&gt; 1.05 mV) was more prevalent in athletes than controls (11.8 vs. 6.2\%, P = 0.017), although RV wall thickness (RVWT) was similar (4.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.9 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.18). Athletes exhibiting electrocardiographic RVH were predominantly male (95.9\%), and demonstrated similar RV dimensions and function to athletes with normal electrocardiograms (RVWT; 4.0 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.95, RV basal dimension; 42.7 ± 5.2 vs. 42.1 ± 5.9 mm, P = 0.43, RV fractional area change; 40.6 ± 7.6 vs. 42.2 ± 8.1\%, P = 0.14). Sensitivity and specificity of Sokolow-Lyon RVH for echocardiographic RVH (\&gt;5 mm) were 14.3 and 88.2\%, respectively. Further evaluation including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging did not diagnose right ventricular pathology in any athlete. None of the cardiomyopathic or pulmonary hypertensive patients exhibited voltage RVH without additional ECG abnormalities.Electrocardiographic voltage criteria for RVH are frequently fulfilled in healthy athletes without underlying RV pathology, and should not prompt further evaluation if observed in isolation. Recognition of this phenomenon should reduce the burden of investigations after pre-participation ECG screening without compromising sensitivity for disease.},

	abstract = {Isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium is a rare disorder of endomyocardial morphogenesis characterized by numerous, excessively prominent ventricular trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses. This study comprised eight cases, including three at necropsy. Ages ranged from 11 months to 22.5 years, with follow-up as long as 5 years. Gross morphological severity ranged from moderately abnormal ventricular trabeculations to profoundly abnormal, loosely compacted trabeculations. Echocardiographic images were diagnostic and corresponded to the morphological appearances at necropsy. The depths of the intertrabecular recesses were assessed by a quantitative echocardiographic X-to-Y ratio and were significantly greater than in normal control subjects (p less than 0.001). Clinical manifestations of the disorder included depressed left ventricular systolic function in five patients, ventricular arrhythmias in five, systemic embolization in three, distinctive facial dysmorphism in three, and familial recurrence in four patients. We conclude that isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium is a rare if not unique disorder with characteristic morphological features that can be identified by two-dimensional echocardiography. The incidence of cardiovascular complications is high. The disorder may be associated with facial dysmorphism and familial recurrence.},

Baseline wander in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is one such example, which can be caused by factors such as respiration, variations in electrode impedance, and excessive body movements. Unless baseline wander is effectively removed, the accuracy of any feature extracted from the ECG, such as timing and duration of the ST-segment, is compromised. This paper approaches this filtering task from a novel standpoint by assuming that the ECG baseline wander comes from an independent and unknown source. The technique utilizes a hierarchical method including a blind source separation (BSS) step, in particular independent component analysis, to eliminate the effect of the baseline wander. We examine the specifics of the components causing the baseline wander and the factors that affect the separation process. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in removing the baseline wander.},

	abstract = {Random forests have emerged as one of the most commonly used nonparametric statistical methods in many scientific areas, particularly in analysis of high throughput genomic data. A general practice in using random forests is to generate a sufficiently large number of trees, although it is subjective as to how large is sufficient. Furthermore, random forests are viewed as “black-box” because of its sheer size. In this work, we address a fundamental issue in the use of random forests: how large does a random forest have to be? To this end, we propose a specific method to find a sub-forest (e.g., in a single digit number of trees) that can achieve the prediction accuracy of a large random forest (in the order of thousands of trees). We tested it on extensive simulation studies and a real study on prognosis of breast cancer. The results show that such sub-forests usually exist and most of them are very small, suggesting they are actually the “representatives” of the whole random forests. We conclude that the sub-forests are indeed the core of a random forest. Thus it is not necessary to use the whole forest for satisfying prediction performance. Also, by reducing the size of a random forest to a manageable size, the random forest is no longer a black-box.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiography is a very common, non-invasive diagnostic procedure and its interpretation is increasingly supported by automatic interpretation algorithms. The progress in the field of automatic ECG interpretation has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first benchmarking results for the recently published, freely accessible PTB-XL dataset, covering a variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks over age and gender prediction to signal quality assessment. We find that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance across all tasks outperforming feature-based algorithms by a large margin. These results are complemented by deeper insights into the classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis. We also put forward benchmarking results for the ICBEB2018 challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. With this resource, we aim to establish the PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG analysis algorithms and encourage other researchers in the field to join these efforts.},

	abstract = {This study proposed an ECG (Electrocardiogram) classification approach using machine learning based on several ECG features. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that measures the electric activity of the heart. The proposed approach is implemented using ML-libs and Scala language on Apache Spark framework; MLlib is Apache Spark’s scalable machine learning library. The key challenge in ECG classification is to handle the irregularities in the ECG signals which is very important to detect the patient status. Therefore, we have proposed an efficient approach to classify ECG signals with high accuracy Each heartbeat is a combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac heart tissues. Heartbeats classification faces some difficulties because these waveforms differ from person to another, they are described by some features. These features are the inputs of machine learning algorithm. In general, using Spark–Scala tools simplifies the usage of many algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) algorithms. On other hand, Spark–Scala is preferred to be used more than other tools when size of processing data is too large. In our case, we have used a dataset with 205,146 records to evaluate the performance of our approach. Machine learning libraries in Spark–Scala provide easy ways to implement many classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GDB), etc.). The proposed method is evaluated and validated on baseline MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia database. The results show that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.75\% using GDB Tree algorithm and 97.98\% using random Forest for binary classification. For multi class classification, it achieved to 98.03\% accuracy using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting tree supports only binary classification.},

	abstract = {Detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias is critical to the diagnosis of patients with cardiac abnormalities. In this paper, a novel approach based on deep learning methodology is proposed for the classification of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We demonstrate the application of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN) for ECG classification following detection of ventricular and supraventricular heartbeats using single-lead ECG. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is illustrated using real ECG signals from the widely-used MIT-BIH database. Simulation results demonstrate that with a suitable choice of parameters, RBM and DBN can achieve high average recognition accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (93.63\%) and of supraventricular ectopic beats (95.57\%) at a low sampling rate of 114 Hz. Experimental results indicate that classifiers built into this deep learning-based framework achieved state-of-the art performance models at lower sampling rates and simple features when compared to traditional methods. Further, employing features extracted at a sampling rate of 114 Hz when combined with deep learning provided enough discriminatory power for the classification task. This performance is comparable to that of traditional methods and uses a much lower sampling rate and simpler features. Thus, our proposed deep neural network algorithm demonstrates that deep learning-based methods offer accurate ECG classification and could potentially be extended to other physiological signal classifications, such as those in arterial blood pressure (ABP), nerve conduction (EMG), and heart rate variability (HRV) studies.},

We evaluate modularity-maximizing using fast greedy and leading eigenvector approximations, infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. For this purpose, we propose to construct a label co-occurrence graph (both weighted and unweighted versions) based on training data and perform community detection to partition the label set. Then, each partition constitutes a label space for separate multi-label classification sub-problems. As a result, we obtain an ensemble of multi-label classifiers that jointly covers the whole label space. Based on the binary relevance and label powerset classification methods, we compare community detection methods to label space divisions against random baselines on 12 benchmark datasets over five evaluation measures. We discover that data-driven approaches are more efficient and more likely to outperform RAkELd than binary relevance or label powerset is, in every evaluated measure. For all measures, apart from Hamming loss, data-driven approaches are significantly better than RAkELd (    α = 0 . 05    ), and at least one data-driven approach is more likely to outperform RAkELd than a priori methods in the case of RAkELd’s best performance. This is the largest RAkELd evaluation published to date with 250 samplings per value for 10 values of RAkELd parameter k on 12 datasets published to date.},

	abstract = {The first electrocardiogram (ECG) from the intact human heart was recorded with a mercury capillary electrometer by Augustus Waller in May 1887 at St. Mary's Hospital, London. The tracings were poor and exhibited only 2 distorted deflections. Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) who was professor of physiology at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, began his studies of the ECG with the mercury capillary electrometer, and improved its distortion mathematically so that he was finally able to register a good representation of the ECG before the beginning of the twentieth century. He later further improved ECG recordings with the introduction of a string galvanometer of his design. Einthoven published his first article about the string galvanometer in 1901, followed by a more detailed description in 1903 which included a report of ECGs taken with the new instrument. The year 2002 marks the centennial of Willem Einthoven's first recording of the ECG in a clinically applicable fashion with the string galvanometer. The clinical use of Einthoven's immobile equipment required transtelephonic transmission of the ECG from the physiology laboratory to the clinic at the Academic Hospital about a mile away as documented in the 1906 paper on the "télécardiogramme". This report contained a wealth of ECG patterns and arrhythmias. Einthoven developed a system of electrocardiographic standardization that continues to be used all over the world and introduced the triaxial bipolar system with 3 limb leads and thus established uniformity of the recording process. Einthoven also conceived the famous equilateral triangle with leads I, II, and III at its sides and the calculation of the electrical axis (in the frontal plane) depicted as a single vector with an arrow at the center of the triangle. Einthoven recognized the great potential importance of the ECG as a diagnostic and investigative tool and his achievements made him the founder of modern electrocardiography. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1924 (2 years after Waller's death) in physiology and medicine, "for the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram."},

The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

for implementation in an FPGA development platform by Lars Jørgen
Aamodt (2013).
The complete ECG system consists of an analogue ECG Front-End, a
Data Acquisition Card, and an FPGA Module based on the Pan-Tompkins
Algorithm for real-time QRS peak detection.
Measurements principles, instrument design and test results were reviewed. The system works as an independent ECG measuring instrument.
An iPad application was designed as an addition to the Android
application designed for the platform. The iPad does not support the
Bluetooth protocol used for transmission in the platform, so TCP/IP
platform was used. The iPad application was tested and verified with
generated data from a TCP/IP server},

	abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

Since then, automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer makes its own errors—sometimes critical—in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Worldwide, millions of ECGs are recorded annually, with the majority automatically analyzed, followed by an immediate interpretation. Limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of CIE were soon recognized and still persist, despite ongoing improvement in ECG algorithms. Unfortunately, inexperienced physicians ordering the ECG may fail to recognize interpretation mistakes and accept the automated diagnosis without criticism. Clinical mismanagement may result, with the risk of exposing patients to useless investigations or potentially dangerous treatment. Consequently, CIE over-reading and conﬁrmation by an experienced ECG reader are essential and are repeatedly recommended in published reports. Implementation of new ECG knowledge is also important. The current status of automated ECG interpretation is reviewed, with suggestions for improvement. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:1183–92) © 2017 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability has been largely used for the assessment of cardiac autonomic activity, due to the direct relationship between cardiac rhythm and the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. In recent years, another technique, pulse rate variability, has been used for assessing heart rate variability information from pulse wave signals, especially from photoplethysmography, a non-invasive, non-intrusive, optical technique that measures the blood volume in tissue. The relationship, however, between pulse rate variability and heart rate variability is not entirely understood, and the effects of cardiovascular changes in pulse rate variability have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the applications in which pulse rate variability has been used, with a special focus on cardiovascular health, and of the studies that have compared heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is presented. It was found that the relationship between heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is not entirely understood yet, and that pulse rate variability might be influenced not only due to technical aspects but also by physiological factors that might affect the measurements obtained from pulse-to-pulse time series extracted from pulse waves. Hence, pulse rate variability must not be considered as a valid surrogate of heart rate variability in all scenarios, and care must be taken when using pulse rate variability instead of heart rate variability. Specifically, the way pulse rate variability is affected by cardiovascular changes does not necessarily reflect the same information as heart rate variability, and might contain further valuable information. More research regarding the relationship between cardiovascular changes and pulse rate variability should be performed to evaluate if pulse rate variability might be useful for the assessment of not only cardiac autonomic activity but also for the analysis of mechanical and vascular autonomic responses to these changes.},

This presents a barrier to collecting the large samples necessary to maintain the statistical power of between-subject psychophysiological comparisons. An alternative to ECG involves an optical pulse sensor or photoplethysmograph run from a smartphone or similar portable device: smartphone pulse rate variability (SPRV). Experiment 1 determined the simultaneous accuracy between ECG and SPRV systems in n = 10 participants at rest. Raw SPRV values showed a consistent positive bias, which was successfully attenuated with correction. Experiment 2 tested an additional n = 10 participants at rest, during attentional load, and during mild stress (exercise). Accuracy was maintained, but slightly attenuated during exercise. The best correction method maintained an accuracy of +/−2\% for low-frequency spectral power, and +/−5\% for high-frequency spectral power over all points. Thus, the SPRV system records a pulse-to-pulse approximation of an ECG-derived heart rate series that is sufﬁciently accurate to perform time- and frequency-domain analysis of its variability, as well as accurately reﬂecting change in autonomic output provided by typical psychophysiological stimuli. This represents a novel method by which an accurate approximation of HRV may be collected for large-sample or naturalistic cardiac psychophysiological research.},

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is fast emerging as a non-invasive research and clinical tool for assessing cardiac and autonomic nervous system function. However, in this study describes a method of stress assessment based on Pulse photoplethysmography (PPG). We assessed the possibility of using the pulse rate variability (PRV) extracted from the PPG signal as an alternative measurement of the HRV signal. Further, to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of HRV extraction from PPG signal, finger-tip PPG and standard lead II ECG signals were simultaneously. A comparative analysis of time domain and frequency domain measures of PRV was carried out. Finally, we present a method of PRV analysis to evaluate mental stress by simple PPG. These results suggest that PRV based on PPG could be used as a surrogate of HRV for the purpose of stress assessment.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate the possibility of computing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indices from the finger Photoplethysmogram. To indicate that whether Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) from PPG signal can be used as an alternative to Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from ECG signal. The Photoplethsmographic (PPG) and Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals from 33 participants were recorded simultaneoussly during resting and exercise conditions. The peaks of PPG and R-waves of ECG were detected and reconstructed to the Peak-to-Peak interval (PPI) and R-to-R interval (RRI) waveforms respectively. In both conditions, the mean and standard deviation (SDNN) of the intervals over 5 minutes were computed from the two waveforms. Results from cross correlation between PPI and RRI show that the average correlation coefficients (r) are higher in resting than the “r” in exercise. In regression analysis of the statistical parameters between RRI and PPI, the determination coefficients (R2) of the means are close to one in both conditions, whereas the R2 of SDNN in exercise is lower than the one in resting. This finding suggests that the HRV indices can be evaluated from PPG with reliability during the rest.},

Alternatives to HRV monitoring, like photoplethysmography (PPG), are being explored as cheaper and unobtrusive non-invasive technologies. We report a new wireless PPG sensor that was tested in detecting changes in HRV, elicited by a mentally stressful task, and to determine if its signal can be used as a surrogate of ECG for HRV analysis. Data were collected simultaneously from volunteers using a PPG and ECG sensor, during a resting and a mentally stressful task. HRV metrics were extracted from these signals and compared to determine the agreement between them and to determine if any changes occurred in the metrics due to the stressful task. For both tasks, a moderate/good agreement was found in the mean interbeat intervals, SDNN, LF, and SD2, and a poor agreement for the pNN50, RMSSD{\textbar}SD1, and HF metrics. The majority of the tested HRV metrics obtained from the PPG signal showed a significant decrease caused by the mental task. The disagreement found between specific HRV features imposes caution when comparing metrics from different technologies. Nevertheless, the tested sensor was successful at detecting changes in the HRV caused by a mental stressor.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability has been largely used for the assessment of cardiac autonomic activity, due to the direct relationship between cardiac rhythm and the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. In recent years, another technique, pulse rate variability, has been used for assessing heart rate variability information from pulse wave signals, especially from photoplethysmography, a non-invasive, non-intrusive, optical technique that measures the blood volume in tissue. The relationship, however, between pulse rate variability and heart rate variability is not entirely understood, and the effects of cardiovascular changes in pulse rate variability have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the applications in which pulse rate variability has been used, with a special focus on cardiovascular health, and of the studies that have compared heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is presented. It was found that the relationship between heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is not entirely understood yet, and that pulse rate variability might be influenced not only due to technical aspects but also by physiological factors that might affect the measurements obtained from pulse-to-pulse time series extracted from pulse waves. Hence, pulse rate variability must not be considered as a valid surrogate of heart rate variability in all scenarios, and care must be taken when using pulse rate variability instead of heart rate variability. Specifically, the way pulse rate variability is affected by cardiovascular changes does not necessarily reflect the same information as heart rate variability, and might contain further valuable information. More research regarding the relationship between cardiovascular changes and pulse rate variability should be performed to evaluate if pulse rate variability might be useful for the assessment of not only cardiac autonomic activity but also for the analysis of mechanical and vascular autonomic responses to these changes.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of heart rates from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during intense physical activity is a very challenging problem. This is because strenuous and high intensity exercise can result in severe motion artifacts in PPG signals, making accurate heart rate (HR) estimation difficult. In this study we investigated a novel technique to accurately reconstruct motion-corrupted PPG signals and HR based on time-varying spectral analysis. The algorithm is called Spectral filter algorithm for Motion Artifacts and heart rate reconstruction (SpaMA). The idea is to calculate the power spectral density of both PPG and accelerometer signals for each time shift of a windowed data segment. By comparing time-varying spectra of PPG and accelerometer data, those frequency peaks resulting from motion artifacts can be distinguished from the PPG spectrum. The SpaMA approach was applied to three different datasets and four types of activities: (1) training datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 12 subjects while performing treadmill exercise from 1 km/h to 15 km/h; (2) test datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 11 subjects while performing forearm and upper arm exercise. (3) Chon Lab dataset including 10 min recordings from 10 subjects during treadmill exercise. The ECG signals from all three datasets provided the reference HRs which were used to determine the accuracy of our SpaMA algorithm. The performance of the SpaMA approach was calculated by computing the mean absolute error between the estimated HR from the PPG and the reference HR from the ECG. The average estimation errors using our method on the first, second and third datasets are 0.89, 1.93 and 1.38 beats/min respectively, while the overall error on all 33 subjects is 1.86 beats/min and the performance on only treadmill experiment datasets (22 subjects) is 1.11 beats/min. Moreover, it was found that dynamics of heart rate variability can be accurately captured using the algorithm where the mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the power spectral densities of the reference and the reconstructed heart rate time series was found to be 0.98. These results show that the SpaMA method has a potential for PPG-based HR monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring during intense physical activities.},

Studies comparing the electrocardiographic index with echocardiography in hypertensive patients and reporting sufficient data were included., Data extraction Data on study populations, echocardiographic criteria, and methodological quality of studies were extracted., Data synthesis Negative likelihood ratios, which indicate to what extent the posterior odds of left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced by a negative test, were calculated., Results 21 studies and data on 5608 patients were analysed. The median prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 33\% (interquartile range 23-41\%) in primary care settings (10 studies) and 65\% (37-81\%) in secondary care settings (11 studies). The median negative likelihood ratio was similar across electrocardiographic indexes, ranging from 0.85 (range 0.34-1.03) for the Romhilt-Estes score (with threshold ≥4 points) to 0.91 (0.70-1.01) for the Gubner index. Using the Romhilt-Estes score in primary care, a negative electrocardiogram result would reduce the typical pre-test probability from 33\% to 31\%. In secondary care the typical pre-test probability of 65\% would be reduced to 63\%., Conclusion Electrocardiographic criteria should not be used to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.},

Occasionally, however, exercise may act as a trigger for arrhythmic death in athletes who harbor an occult pathological substrate. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young athletes (≤35 years old) are secondary to inherited cardiac diseases, while ischaemic heart disease predominates in older athletes. In the absence of compulsory national or international registries of SCD in athletes, it is difficult to define the exact scale of the problem. In addition, the lack of post-mortem evaluation by pathologists with expertise in cardiac adaptation to exercise and inherited cardiac diseases casts doubt to the reliability of the reported causes. The proposed preventative strategies focus primarily on preventing deaths by cardiovascular evaluation of athletes and the use of automated external defibrillators in athletic venues. Cardiovascular screening of first-degree relatives, though often neglected, has the potential to avert further tragedies given the inherited nature of most conditions predisposing to SCD in the young. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology and causes of SCD in athletes and explores potential prevention strategies.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review study on the recent DL methods applied to the ECG signal for the classification purposes. This study considers various types of the DL methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). From the 75 studies reported within 2017 and 2018, CNN is dominantly observed as the suitable technique for feature extraction, seen in 52\% of the studies. DL methods showed high accuracy in correct classification of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) (100\%), Supraventricular Ectopic Beats (SVEB) (99.8\%), and Ventricular Ectopic Beats (VEB) (99.7\%) using the GRU/LSTM, CNN, and LSTM, respectively.},

	abstract = {Due to high dimensionality and multiple variables, unsupervised classification of 12-lead ECG signals involves challenges and difficulties. In order to automatically discover unknown physiological features from raw multivariate signals and detect abnormal cardiac activities of a subject, we proposed an unsupervised classification scheme of 12-lead ECG signals using wavelet tensor decomposition and two-dimensional Gaussian spectral clustering. After filtering and segmentation, each ECG sample is converted into a wavelet tensor by the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). Main features of ECG samples can be clearly investigated in a multiple feature space constructed by the ECG lead, time and frequency sub-band. Then the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of ECG tensors as well as preserve the data interior structure. Taking account of both magnitude and orientation of feature vectors, a novel two-dimensional Gaussian spectral clustering (TGSC) is devised to cluster different 12-lead ECG samples. Furthermore, the dataset obtained from practical 12-lead ECG experiment and two datasets from PhysioBank are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. Clustering results show that more useful features of ECG signals can be extracted by the wavelet-tensor-based MPCA than by vector-based PCA. With the two-dimensional Gaussian proximity matrix, the clustering accuracy of TGSC is also higher than that of the traditional spectral clustering.},

Highly accurate diagnosis of AF based on 12-lead ECG is valuable and remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for AF detection based on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural network (DDNN) to detect AF in ECG waveforms with a length of 10s. A large set of 16,557 12-lead ECG recordings collected from multiple hospitals and wearable ECG devices were used to evaluate the performance of the DDNN. In the test dataset (3312 12-lead ECG recordings), the DDNN obtained high performance with an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.26\%, a sensitivity of 99.19 ± 0.31\%, and a specificity of 99.44 ± 0.17\%. Its high performance and automatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of AF or future screening of AF in wearable devices.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00\% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

There are also no public databases available for eECGs as is the case for human ECGs. In this paper we propose the use of wavelet transforms for both filtering and QRS detection in eECGs. In addition, we propose a novel robust deep neural network using a parallel convolutional neural network architecture for ECG beat classification. The network was trained and tested using both the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and an own made eECG dataset with 26.440 beats on 4 classes: normal, premature ventricular contraction, premature atrial contraction and noise. The network was optimized using a genetic algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7\% and 92.6\% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and eECG database respectively. Afterwards, transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the eECG database was applied after which the average accuracy, recall, positive predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1\%.},

	abstract = {The performance of automatic speech recognition can often be signiﬁcantly improved by combining multiple systems together. Though beneﬁcial, ensemble methods can be computationally expensive, often requiring multiple decoding runs. An alternative approach, appropriate for deep learning schemes, is to adopt student-teacher training. Here, a student model is trained to reproduce the outputs of a teacher model, or ensemble of teachers. The standard approach is to train the student model on the frame posterior outputs of the teacher. This paper examines the interaction between student-teacher training schemes and sequence training criteria, which have been shown to yield signiﬁcant performance gains over frame-level criteria. There are several possible options for integrating sequence training, including training of the ensemble and further training of the student. This paper also proposes an extension to the studentteacher framework, where the student is trained to emulate the hypothesis posterior distribution of the teacher, or ensemble of teachers. This sequence student-teacher training approach allows the beneﬁt of student-teacher training to be directly combined with sequence training schemes. These approaches are evaluated on two speech recognition tasks: a Wall Street Journal based task and a low-resource Tok Pisin conversational telephone speech task from the IARPA Babel programme.},

The proposed solution consists of two stages of learning a) learning ECG representations and b) learning to classify emotions. ECG representations are learned by a signal transformation recognition network. The network learns high-level abstract representations from unlabeled ECG data. Six different signal transformations are applied to the ECG signals, and transformation recognition is performed as pretext tasks. Training the model on pretext tasks helps the network learn spatiotemporal representations that generalize well across different datasets and different emotion categories. We transfer the weights of the self-supervised network to an emotion recognition network, where the convolutional layers are kept frozen and the dense layers are trained with labelled ECG data. We show that the proposed solution considerably improves the performance compared to a network trained using fully-supervised learning. New state-of-the-art results are set in classification of arousal, valence, affective states, and stress for the four utilized datasets. Extensive experiments are performed, providing interesting insights into the impact of using a multi-task self-supervised structure instead of a single-task model, as well as the optimum level of difficulty required for the pretext self-supervised tasks.},

When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal evaluation is routinely used in clinics as a significant diagnostic method for detecting arrhythmia. However, it is very labor intensive to externally evaluate ECG signals, due to their small amplitude. Using automated detection and classification methods in the clinic can assist doctors in making accurate and expeditious diagnoses of diseases. In this study, we developed a classification method for arrhythmia based on the combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, which was then used to diagnose eight ECG signals, including a normal sinus rhythm. The ECG data of the experiment were derived from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The experimental method mainly consisted of two parts. The input data of the model were two-dimensional grayscale images converted from one-dimensional signals, and detection and classification of the input data was carried out using the combined model. The advantage of this method is that it does not require performing feature extraction or noise filtering on the ECG signal. The experimental results showed that the implemented method demonstrated high classification performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity equal to 99.01\%, 99.57\%, and 97.67\%, respectively. Our proposed model can assist doctors in accurately detecting arrhythmia during routine ECG screening.},

	abstract = {Classification is one of the most popular topics in healthcare and bioinformatics, especially in relation to arrhythmia detection. Arrhythmias are irregularities in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat which, in some cases, may occur sporadically in a subject’s daily life. To capture these infrequent events, a Holter device is usually employed to record long-term ECG data. Therefore, the automatic recognition of abnormal heartbeats from a large amount of ECG data is an important and essential task. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of ECG beat classification. At the same time, deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance in various fields. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for ECG beat classification. We have conducted the experiments on the well-known MIT–BIH Arrhythmia Database, and compared our results with the scientific literature. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art in terms of accuracy, but also competitive in terms of sensitivity and specificity.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a myocardial anoxic incapacitation caused by severe cardiovascular obstruction that can cause irreversible injury or even death. In medical field, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common and effective way to diagnose myocardial infarction, which often requires a wealth of medical knowledge. It is necessary to develop an approach that can detect the MI automatically. Methods: In this paper, we propose a multi-branch fusion framework for automatic MI screening from 12-lead ECG images, which consists of multi-branch network, feature fusion and classification network. First, we use text detection and position alignment to automatically separate twelve leads from ECG images. Then, those 12 leads are input into the multi-branch network constructed by a shallow neural network to get 12 feature maps. After concatenating those feature maps by depth fusion, classification is explored to judge the given ECG is MI or not. Results: Based on extensive experiments on an ECG image dataset, performances of different combinations of structures are analyzed. The proposed network is compared with other networks and also compared with physicians in the practical use. All the experiments verify that the proposed method is effective for MI screening based on ECG images, which achieves accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of 94.73\%, 96.41\%, 95.94\% and 93.79\% respectively. Conclusions: Rather than using the typical one-dimensional electrical ECG signal, this paper gives an effective model to screen MI by analyzing 12-lead ECG images. Extracting and analyzing these 12 leads from their corresponding ECG images is a good attempt in the application of MI screening.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00\% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units.},

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33\% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.},

In total, 60 athletes (11.6\%) were referred for additional testing. The athletes presented a very low level of psychological stress before and a slight decrease immediately after the examination as measured by the REST-Q 76 Sport questionnaire. Athletes needing further examinations did not present a higher level of stress after the initial examination compared with athletes with normal test results. Overall, very few athletes were diagnosed with a cardiac condition that increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

While Explainable AI is an emerging field of research, there is no consensus on the definition, quantification, and formalization of explainability. In fact, the quantification of explainability is an open challenge. In our previous work, we incorporated domain knowledge for better explainability, however, we were unable to quantify the extent of explainability. In this work, we (1) briefly analyze the definitions of explainability from the perspective of different disciplines (e.g., psychology, social science), properties of explanation, explanation methods, and human-friendly explanations; and (2) propose and formulate an approach to quantify the extent of explainability.

	abstract = {Test based on electrocardiograms (ECG) that record the heart electrical activity can help in early detection of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) where the heart muscle is partially thickened and blood flow is (potentially fatally) obstructed. This paper presents a cardiovascular-patient classifier we developed to identify HCM patients using standard 10-seconds, 12-lead ECG signals. Patients are classified as having HCM if the majority of the heartbeats are recognized as HCM. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual heartbeats segmented from 12-lead ECG signals as HCM beats, where heartbeats from non-HCM cardiovascular patients are used as controls. We extracted 504 morphological and temporal features - both commonly used and newly-developed ones-from ECG signals for heartbeat classification. To assess classification performance, we trained and tested a random forest classifier and a support vector machine classifier using 5-fold cross validation. The patient-classification precision of both classifiers are close to 0.85. Recall (sensitivity) and specificity are approximately 0.90. We also conducted feature selection experiments by gradually removing the least informative features; the results show that a relatively small subset of 304 highly informative features can achieve performance measures comparable to that achieved by using the complete set of features.},

In this field, sensor location has been demonstrated to play a crucial role. The goal of this study was to investigate PPG and PRV signal quality acquired from two body locations: finger and wrist. We simultaneously acquired the PPG and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals from sixteen healthy subjects (aged 28.5 \&plusmn; 3.5, seven females) who followed an experimental protocol of affective stimulation through visual stimuli. Statistical tests demonstrated that PPG signals acquired from the wrist and the finger presented different signal quality indexes (kurtosis and Shannon entropy), with higher values for the wrist-PPG. Then we propose to apply the cross-mapping (CM) approach as a new method to quantify the PRV signal quality. We found that the performance achieved using the two sites was significantly different in all the experimental sessions (p \&lt; 0.01), and the PRV dynamics acquired from the finger were the most similar to heart rate variability (HRV) dynamics.},

Whether used for screening or diagnostic purposes, ECG facilitates the detection of conditions at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). ECG interpretation standards have evolved over the last decade as scientific studies improved the division of physiological from pathological ECG changes. The Seattle Criteria (2013) provided consensus recommendations by an international panel of experts in sports cardiology and emerged as a practical guideline to improve ECG interpretation accuracy.1 In 2017, the International Criteria was released by the same expert panel and intended to supersede prior guidelines as the current standard for ECG interpretation in athletes.2 Each revision of ECG standards has improved specificity without compromising sensitivity for ECG-detectable pathological conditions associated with SCD.3–5 In a cohort of 5258 college athletes from the USA, application of the International Criteria lowered the false-positive rate compared with the Seattle Criteria from 2.8\% to just 1.3\%.3 Likewise, in a cohort of 11 168 adolescent soccer players from the UK, the total number of athletes with an abnormal ECG was reduced 57\% by moving from the Seattle Criteria (4.3\%) to the International Criteria (1.8\%).4

The ECGs were collected from three campuses of Tongji Hospital (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) and annotated by cardiologists. We used these datasets to develop a convolutional neural network approach to generate diagnoses of arrythmias. We collected a test dataset of ECGs from a new group of patients not included in the training dataset. The test dataset was annotated by consensus of a committee of board-certified, actively practicing cardiologists. To evaluate the performance of the model we assessed the F1 score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as well as quantifying sensitivity and specificity. To validate our results, findings for the test dataset were compared with diagnoses made by 53 ECG physicians working in cardiology departments who had a wide range of experience in ECG interpretation (range 0 to {\textgreater}12 years). An external public validation dataset of 962 ECGs from other hospitals was used to study generalisability of the diagnostic model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our training and validation dataset comprised 180 112 ECGs from 70 692 patients, collected between Jan 1, 2012, and Apr 30, 2019. The test dataset comprised 828 ECGs corresponding to 828 new patients, recorded between Sept 11, 2012, and Aug 30, 2019. At the multilabel level, our deep learning approach to diagnosing heart abnormalities resulted in an exact match in 658 (80\%) of 828 ECGs, exceeding the mean performance of physicians (552 [67\%] for physicians with 0–6 years of experience; 571 [69\%] for physicians with 7–12 years of experience; 621 [75\%] for physicians with more than 12 years of experience). Our model had an overall mean F1 score of 0·887 compared with 0·789 for physicians with 0–6 years of experience, 0·815 for physicians with 7–12 years of experience, and 0·831 for physicians with more than 12 years of experience. The model had a mean AUC ROC score of 0·983 (95\% CI 0·980–0·986), sensitivity of 0·867 (0·849–0·885) and specificity of 0·995 (0·994–0·996).

	abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

	abstract = {Aim To investigate the accuracy of the recently published international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes in a large cohort of white and black adolescent soccer players.
Methods 11 168 soccer players (mean age 16.4±1.2 years) were evaluated with a health questionnaire, ECG and echocardiogram; 10 581 (95\%) of the players were male and 10 163 (91\%) were white. ECGs were retrospectively analysed according to (1) the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations, (2) Seattle criteria, (3) refined criteria and (4) the international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes.
Results The ESC recommendations resulted in a higher number of abnormal ECGs compared with the Seattle, refined and international criteria (13.2\%, 4.3\%, 2.9\% and 1.8\%, respectively). All four criteria were associated with a higher prevalence of abnormal ECGs in black athletes compared with white athletes (ESC: 16.2\% vs 12.9\%; Seattle: 5.9\% vs 4.2\%; refined: 3.8\% vs 2.8\%; international 3.6\% vs 1.6\%; p{\textless}0.001 each). Compared with ESC recommendations, the Seattle, refined and international criteria identified a lower number of abnormal ECGs—by 67\%, 78\% and 86\%, respectively. All four criteria identified 36 (86\%) of 42 athletes with serious cardiac pathology. Compared with ESC recommendations, the Seattle criteria improved specificity from 87\% to 96\% in white athletes and 84\% to 94\% in black athletes. The international recommendations demonstrated the highest specificity for white (99\%) and black (97\%) athletes and a sensitivity of 86\%.
Conclusions The 2017 international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes can be applied to adolescent athletes to detect serious cardiac disease. These recommendations perform more effectively than previous ECG criteria in both white and black adolescent soccer players.},

	abstract = {Background— US high schools are increasingly adopting automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for use in campus settings. We analyzed the effectiveness of emergency response planning for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in a large cohort of US high schools that had onsite AED programs.Methods and Results— A cohort of US high schools with at least 1 onsite AED was identified from the National Registry for AED Use in Sports. A school representative completed a comprehensive survey on emergency planning and provided details of any SCA incident occurring within 6 months of survey completion. Surveys were completed between December 2006 and July 2007. In total, 1710 high schools with an onsite AED program were studied. Although 83\% (1428 of 1710) of schools have an established emergency response plan for SCA, only 40\% practice and review the plan at least annually with potential school responders. A case of SCA was reported by 36 of 1710 schools (2.1\%). The 36 SCA victims included 14 high school student athletes (mean age, 16 years; range, 14 to 17 years) and 22 older nonstudents (mean age, 57 years; range, 42 to 71 years) such as employees and spectators. No cases were reported in student nonathletes. Of the 36 SCA cases, 35 (97\%) were witnessed, 34 (94\%) received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 30 (83\%) received an AED shock. Twenty-three SCA victims (64\%) survived to hospital discharge, including 9 of the 14 student athletes and 14 of the 22 older nonstudents.Conclusions— School-based AED programs provide a high survival rate for both student athletes and older nonstudents who suffer SCA on school grounds. High schools are strongly encouraged to implement onsite AED programs as part of a comprehensive emergency response plan to SCA.},

	abstract = {Background—The true incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in US athletes is unknown. Current estimates are based largely on case identification through public media reports and estimated participation rates. The purpose of this study was to more precisely estimate the incidence of SCD in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) student-athletes and assess the accuracy of traditional methods for collecting data on SCD.Methods and Results—From January 2004 through December 2008, all cases of sudden death in NCAA student-athletes were identified by use of an NCAA database, weekly systematic search of public media reports, and catastrophic insurance claims. During the 5-year period, there were 273 deaths and a total of 1 969 663 athlete participant-years. Of these 273 deaths, 187 (68\%) were due to nonmedical or traumatic causes, 80 (29\%) to medical causes, and 6 (2\%) to unknown causes. Cardiovascular-related sudden death was the leading cause of death in 45 (56\%) of 80 medical cases, and represented 75\% of sudden deaths during exertion. The incidence of SCD was 1:43 770 participants per year. Among NCAA Division I male basketball players, the rate of SCD was 1:3100 per year. Thirty-nine (87\%) of the 45 cardiac cases were identified in the NCAA database, only 25 (56\%) by use of public media reports, and 9 (20\%) from catastrophic claims data.Conclusions—SCD is the leading medical cause of death and death during exercise in NCAA student-athletes. Current methods of data collection underestimate the risk of SCD. Accurate assessment of SCD incidence is necessary to shape appropriate health policy decisions and develop effective strategies for prevention.},

The impact of such a program on prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in the athlete remains to be determined.ObjectiveTo analyze trends in incidence rates and cardiovascular causes of sudden death in young competitive athletes in relation to preparticipation screening.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA population-based study of trends in sudden cardiovascular death in athletic and nonathletic populations aged 12 to 35 years in the Veneto region of Italy between 1979 and 2004. A parallel study examined trends in cardiovascular causes of disqualification from competitive sports in 42 386 athletes undergoing preparticipation screening at the Center for Sports Medicine in Padua (22 312 in the early screening period [1982-1992] and 20 074 in the late screening period [1993-2004]).Main Outcome MeasuresIncidence trends of total cardiovascular and cause-specific sudden death in screened athletes and unscreened nonathletes of the same age range over a 26-year period.ResultsDuring the study period, 55 sudden cardiovascular deaths occurred in screened athletes (1.9 deaths/100 000 person-years) and 265 sudden deaths in unscreened nonathletes (0.79 deaths/100 000 person-years). The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular death in athletes decreased by 89\% (from 3.6/100 000 person-years in 1979-1980 to 0.4/100 000 person-years in 2003-2004; P for trend \&lt; .001), whereas the incidence of sudden death among the unscreened nonathletic population did not change significantly. The mortality decline started after mandatory screening was implemented and persisted to the late screening period. Compared with the prescreening period (1979-1981), the relative risk of sudden cardiovascular death in athletes was 0.56 in the early screening period (95\% CI, 0.29-1.15; P = .04) and 0.21 in the late screening period (95\% CI, 0.09-0.48; P = .001). Most of the reduced mortality was due to fewer cases of sudden death from cardiomyopathies (from 1.50/100 000 person-years in the prescreening period to 0.15/100 000 person-years in the late screening period; P for trend = .002). During the study period, 879 athletes (2.0\%) were disqualified from competition due to cardiovascular causes at the Center for Sports Medicine: 455 (2.0\%) in the early screening period and 424 (2.1\%) in the late screening period. The proportion of athletes who were disqualified for cardiomyopathies increased from 20 (4.4\%) of 455 in the early screening period to 40 (9.4\%) of 424 in the late screening period (P = .005).ConclusionsThe incidence of sudden cardiovascular death in young competitive athletes has substantially declined in the Veneto region of Italy since the introduction of a nationwide systematic screening. Mortality reduction was predominantly due to a lower incidence of sudden death from cardiomyopathies that paralleled the increasing identification of athletes with cardiomyopathies at preparticipation screening.},

Because of the large number of genes and alleles attributed to DCM, comprehensive genetic testing encompasses ever-increasing gene panels. Genetic diagnosis can help predict prognosis, especially with regard to arrhythmia risk for certain subtypes. Moreover, cascade genetic testing in family members can identify those who are at risk or with early stage disease, offering the opportunity for early intervention. This review will address diagnosis and management of DCM, including the role of genetic evaluation. We will also overview distinct genetic pathways linked to DCM and their pathogenetic mechanisms. Historically, cardiac morphology has been used to classify cardiomyopathy subtypes. Determining genetic variants is emerging as an additional adjunct to help further refine subtypes of DCM, especially where arrhythmia risk is increased, and ultimately contribute to clinical management.},

	abstract = {Temporal trends of the prevalence and incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been well established in Asian populations. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Services database, we identified patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM between 2010 and 2016. The annual prevalence and incidence of HCM, and their clinical characteristics were investigated. The prevalence of HCM has increased from 0.016\% (n = 6313) in 2010 to 0.031\% (n = 13,035) in 2016. During a 7-year period, 13,229 patients were newly diagnosed with HCM. The incidence rate increased from 4.15 (per 100,000 person-years) in 2010 to 5.6 in 2016. The prevalence and incidence of HCM increased with age and peaked during the 70s, with male predominance in all age groups. Chest pain is the most frequent clinical presentation followed by shortness of breath and syncope. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the two most common comorbidities. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in about 1/3 and 1/4 of patients with HCM, respectively. The prevalence and incidence of HCM gradually increased from 2010 to 2016, possibly due to heightened recognition of the disease. Given the progressively high incidence of HCM with age and high prevalence of coexisting modifiable risk factors, continued efforts are required to increase awareness regarding HCM-related symptoms and potential complications.},

	abstract = {Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. Deep learning methods have achieved promising results predictive healthcare tasks using ECG signals.
Objective: This paper conducts a systematic review of deep learning methods on ECG data from both model and application perspectives.
Methods: We extracted papers that deploy deep learning (deep neural networks) models on ECG data that published between January 1st 2010 and February 29th 2020 from Google Scholar, PubMed, and DBLP. We then analyze them in three aspects, including task, model, and data. Last we discuss open challenges and unsolved problems in this area.
Results: The total number of papers is 191; among them, 108 papers are published after the year 2019. Almost all kinds of common deep learning architectures have been used in ECG analytics tasks like disease detection/classiﬁcation, annotation/localization, sleep staging, biometric human identiﬁcation, denoising, and so on.
Conclusion: The number of works about deep learning on Electrocardiogram data is growing explosively in recent years. Indeed, these works have achieved a far better performance in terms of accuracy. However, there are some new challenges and problems like interpretability, scalability, efﬁciency, which need to be addressed and paid more attention. Moreover, it is also worth investigating by discovering new interesting applications from both the dataset view and the method view.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection of arrhythmia is of great significance for early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Traditional feature engineering methods based on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and data representation ability, so the traditional research on pattern recognition of arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, with the increase of deep learning technology, automatic feature extraction of ECG data based on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the complementary strength between different schemes, in this paper, we propose an arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation (MRR) of ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based representations, together with hand-crafted features of ECG, forms the MRR, which is the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed method is 0.9238, which is 1.31\%, 0.62\%, 1.18\% and 0.6\% higher than that of each channel model. From the perspective of architecture, this proposed method is highly scalable and can be employed as an example for arrhythmia recognition.},

              Aims 
              Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has a high incidence and clinical importance, the conventional diagnosis criteria for detecting LVH using electrocardiography (ECG) has not been satisfied. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting LVH.
            
            
              Methods and results
              This retrospective cohort study involved the review of 21 286 patients who were admitted to two hospitals between October 2016 and July 2018 and underwent 12-lead ECG and echocardiography within 4 weeks. The patients in one hospital were divided into a derivation and internal validation dataset, while the patients in the other hospital were included in only an external validation dataset. An AI algorithm based on an ensemble neural network (ENN) combining convolutional and deep neural network was developed using the derivation dataset. And we visualized the ECG area that the AI algorithm used to make the decision. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the AI algorithm based on ENN was 0.880 (95\% confidence interval 0.877–0.883) and 0.868 (0.865–0.871) during the internal and external validations. These results significantly outperformed the cardiologist’s clinical assessment with Romhilt-Estes point system and Cornell voltage criteria, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine. At the same specificity, the AI algorithm based on ENN achieved 159.9\%, 177.7\%, and 143.8\% higher sensitivities than those of the cardiologist’s assessment, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine.

              An AI algorithm based on ENN was highly able to detect LVH and outperformed cardiologists, conventional methods, and other machine learning techniques.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden cardiac death.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to develop an artiﬁcial intelligence approach for the detection of HCM based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).
METHODS A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and validated using digital 12-lead ECG from 2,448 patients with a veriﬁed HCM diagnosis and 51,153 non-HCM age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ability of the CNN to detect HCM was then tested on a different dataset of 612 HCM and 12,788 control subjects.
RESULTS In the combined datasets, mean age was 54.8 Æ 15.9 years for the HCM group and 57.5 Æ 15.5 years for the control group. After training and validation, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN in the validation dataset was 0.95 (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.94 to 0.97) at the optimal probability threshold of 11\% for having HCM. When applying this probability threshold to the testing dataset, the CNN’s AUC was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.95 to 0.96) with sensitivity 87\% and speciﬁcity 90\%. In subgroup analyses, the AUC was 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria and 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) among patients with a normal ECG. The model performed particularly well in younger patients (sensitivity 95\%, speciﬁcity 92\%). In patients with HCM with and without sarcomeric mutations, the model-derived median probabilities for having HCM were 97\% and 96\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS ECG-based detection of HCM by an artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm can be achieved with high diagnostic performance, particularly in younger patients. This model requires further reﬁnement and external validation, but it may hold promise for HCM screening. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2020;75:722–33) © 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

	abstract = {Automatic arrhythmia detection from Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a simpler, more noise-immune solution than traditional methods in multi-class arrhythmia classiﬁcation. However, suﬀering from lack of consideration for temporal feature of ECG signal, CNN couldn’t accept varied-length ECG signal and had limited performance in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. To address these issues, we proposed attention-based time-incremental convolutional neural network (ATI-CNN), a deep neural network model achieving both spatial and temporal fusion of information from ECG signals by integrating CNN, recurrent cells and attention module. Comparing to CNN model, this model features ﬂexible input length, halved parameter amount as well as more than 90\% computation reduction in real-time processing. The experiment result shows that, ATI-CNN reached an overall classiﬁcation accuracy of 81.2\%. In comparison with a classical 16-layer CNN named VGGNet, ATI-CNN achieved accuracy increases of 7.7\% in average and up to 26.8\% in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. Combining all these excellent features, ATI-CNN oﬀered an exempliﬁcation for all kinds of varied-length signal processing problems.},

ECG abnormalities in athletes are classified into two groups—‘common and training-related’ (Group 1) and ‘uncommon and training-unrelated’ (Group 2)—based on their prevalence, relation to exercise training, association with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and need for further investigations. The present chapter reviews the abnormalities that may be found in an athlete ECG and proposes criteria for interpretation of such changes as normal variants or abnormal findings that need further assessment to exclude an underlying cardiac disease.},

	abstract = {Long QT syndrom (LQTS) is a heart disorder that can cause uncontrollable arrhythmias and in some cases sudden death on healthy individuals[1]. LQTS can be an inherited disorder or provoked due to medication for treating of other medical conditions[2]. The arrhythmias can occur during exercise, as a reaction to stress or when sleeping[1]. The disorder origins from abnormal electrical signalling in the heart’s lower chambers, the ventricles[1]. In order to estimate the QT interval, the QRS onset and T offset needs to be detected in the ECG signal. A study of how the features from multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transform can be used for estimating the QT inteval has been further examined. The results shows that the algorithm developed misses the QRS onset with a mean distance of 2.53 samples, and the T offset with 9.25 samples, on a great variety of ECG morphology.},

We present typical examples of a medical case study and technical applications related to diagnosing ECG, which include (i) a recently patented data classifier on the basis of deep learning model, (ii) a deep neural network scheme to diagnose variable types of arrhythmia through wearable ECG monitoring devices, and (iii) implementation of the health cloud platform, which consists of automatic detection, data mining, and classifying via the Android terminal module. Our work establishes a cross-area study, which relates artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, cloud computing on huge amount of data to minishape ECG monitoring devices, and portable interaction platforms. Experimental results display the technical advantages such as saving cost, better reliability, and higher accuracy of deep learning-based models in contrast to conventional schemes on cardiac diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Throughout civilization, animals have played a pivotal role in the advancement of science and medicine. From as early as 400 BC when Hippocrates recognized that diseases had natural causes, the steadfast advances made by biologists, scientists, physicians and scholars were fueled by timely and important facts and information- much of it gained through animal observations that contributed importantly to understanding anatomy, physiology, and pathology. There have been many breakthroughs and historic developments. For example, William Harvey in the 16th and 17th centuries clariﬁed the importance of the circulatory system, aided by observations in dogs and pigs, which helped to clarify and conﬁrm his concepts. The nineteenth century witnessed advances in physical examination techniques including auscultation and percussion. These helped create the basis for enhanced proﬁciency in clinical cardiology. An explosion of technologic advances that followed in the 20th century have made possible sophisticated, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostics. This permitted rapid patient assessment, effective monitoring, the development of new cardiotonic drugs, clinical trials to assess efﬁcacy, and multi-therapy strategies. The latter 20th century has marshaled a dizzying array of advances in medical genetics and molecular science, expanding the frontiers of etiologies and disease mechanisms in man, with important implications for animal health. Veterinary medicine has evolved during the last half century, from a trade designed to serve agrarian cultures, to a diverse profession supporting an array of career opportunities ranging from private, specialty practice, to highly organized, specialized medicine and subspecialty academic training programs in cardiology and allied disciplines.},

	abstract = {Respiratory rate (RR) is a key parameter used in healthcare for monitoring and predicting patient deterioration. However, continuous and automatic estimation of this parameter from wearable sensors is still a challenging task. Various methods have been proposed to estimate RR from wearable sensors using windowed segments of the data; e.g., often using a minimum of 32 s. Little research has been reported in the literature concerning the instantaneous detection of respiratory rate from such sources. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a method to estimate instantaneous respiratory rate (IRR) from body-worn reﬂectance photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. The proposed method relies on a nonlinear time-frequency representation, termed the wavelet synchrosqueezed transform (WSST). We apply the latter to derived modulations of the PPG that arise from the act of breathing.We validate the proposed algorithm using (i) a custom device with a PPG probe placed on various body positions and (ii) a commercial wrist-worn device (WaveletHealth Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Comparator reference data were obtained via a thermocouple placed under the nostrils, providing ground-truth information concerning respiration cycles. Tracking instantaneous frequencies was performed in the joint time-frequency spectrum of the (4 Hz re-sampled) respiratory-induced modulation using the WSST, from data obtained from 10 healthy subjects. The estimated instantaneous respiratory rates have shown to be highly correlated with breath-by-breath variations derived from the reference signals. The proposed method produced more accurate results compared to averaged RR obtained using 32 s windows investigated with overlap between successive windows of (i) zero and (ii) 28 s. For a set of ﬁve healthy subjects, the averaged similarity between reference RR and instantaneous RR, given by the longest common subsequence (LCSS) algorithm, was calculated as 0.69; this compares with averaged similarity of 0.49 using 32 s windows with 28 s overlap between successive windows. The results provide insight into estimation of IRR and show that upper body positions produced PPG signals from which a better respiration signal was extracted than for other body locations.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been widely used to assess cardiovascular function. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated the effect of measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative comparison on this.
Methods: Thirty six healthy subjects participated in this study. For each subject, PPG signals were sequentially recorded for 1 min from six different body sites (ﬁnger, wrist under (anatomically volar), wrist upper (dorsal), arm, earlobe, and forehead) under both normal and deep breathing patterns. For each body site under a certain breathing pattern, the mean amplitude was ﬁrstly derived from recorded PPG waveform which was then normalized to derive several waveform characteristics including the pulse peak time (Tp), dicrotic notch time (Tn), and the reﬂection index (RI). The effects of breathing pattern and measurement site on the waveform characteristics were ﬁnally investigated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc multiple comparisons.
Results: Under both breathing patterns, the PPG measurements from the ﬁnger achieved the highest percentage of analyzable waveforms for extracting waveform characteristics. There were signiﬁcant effects of breathing pattern on Tn and RI (larger Tn and smaller RI with deep breathing on average, both p {\textless} 0.03). The effects of measurement site on mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI were signiﬁcant (all p {\textless} 0.001). The key results were that, under both breathing patterns, the mean amplitude from ﬁnger PPG was signiﬁcantly larger and its Tp and RI were signiﬁcantly smaller than those from the other ﬁve sites (all p {\textless} 0.001, except p = 0.04 for the Tp of “wrist under”), and Tn was only signiﬁcantly larger than that from the earlobe (both p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion: This study has quantitatively conﬁrmed the effect of PPG measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics (including mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI), providing scientiﬁc evidence for a better understanding of the PPG waveform variations between different body sites.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this paper was to compare photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals measured from the wrist and finger and to evaluate if wrist PPG signal could be used to calculate pulse arrival time (PAT), the time delay between electrocardiogram (ECG) R peak and a feature (e.g. peak, foot, first derivative peak) in the PPG signal. Further, the correlation between pulse wave velocity (rePWV, defined as PWV from ECG R peak to extremity) and systolic blood pressure was studied. Approach: Thirty subjects were measured at rest by a trained research nurse. For reference measurement, chest ECG and finger PPG were measured using commercial sensors. Wrist PPG and arm ECG were measured with a custom-made setup, where the PPG sensor was located at the back surface of the forearm. Main results: Reference finger and wrist PPG signals were found to differ in shape and also in amplitude. The PPG foot or first derivative peak detection methods seemed to be the most suitable methods for wrist PAT calculation. The Pearson correlation coefficient between blood pressure and rePWV was found to be 0.44 for the reference finger measurement and 0.37 for the wrist measurement. Significance: Wrist PPG signal is widely used in optical heart rate monitors. Based on the results obtained in this study, wrist PPG signal may be used also for PAT calculation. The use of PAT for blood pressure estimation still has challenges, but PAT as such could be used as an interesting indicator of vascular health.},

	abstract = {The velocity of the propagating arterial pulse wave (pulse wave velocity, PWV) has been proposed as an unobtrusive and possibly continuous surrogate measure of systolic blood pressure (SBP). PWV is derived from the arrival time of the blood pulse at a peripheral arterial location, most often the ﬁnger. Reported performances were not yet accurate enough for clinical application but good enough as an unobtrusive surrogate in other settings. However, the ﬁnger PPG is not an ideal location in the home setting as it obstructs hand movement and can suffer from peripheral vasomotion and orthostatic pressure changes. In this paper we examine the viability of other pulse arrival locations for the measurement of PWV. PWV was derived to the ﬁnger (most common location), wrist (less obtrusive location), ear (more proximal) and ankle (more distal). Correlation analysis for PWV from each location with SBP was performed and the calibration procedure was studied. Wrist PWV accuracy is found to be comparable to ﬁnger PWV in terms of correlation and estimation error with SBP. The ear PWV, being a theoretically favorable location, is shown to have a larger inter-subject variance in the calibration procedure compared to other locations. Ankle PWV shows stable calibration parameters across subjects but Bland-Altmann analysis reveals unusual error trends. In conclusion, while results indicate that all sensor locations are usable to some extent, there are still some distinct properties associated with each sensor location that should be taken into account when designing an SBP algorithm based on PWV.},

Four methods to calculate PAT from the measured signals were evaluated. PAT was calculated as the time delay between ECG R peak and one of the following points in the PPG waveform: peak (maximum value of PPG waveform), foot (minimum value of PPG waveform), dpeak (maximum value of the first derivative of PPG waveform) and ddpeak (maximum value of the second derivative of PPG waveform). In addition to PAT calculation, pulse period (PP) intervals based on the detected features were determined and compared to RR intervals derived from ECG signal.

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography(PPG) as a non-invasive tool for monitoring various cardiovascular parameters, has become popular due to the ease of wearable integration and pervasive nature. Due to unobtrusive nature of sensor placement at wrist, smartwatches and wrist based ﬁtness bands have gained popularity. However, any movement of the wrist along with frequent loose contacts signiﬁcantly corrupts the PPG signal. Reliable peak detection from the corrupted PPG signal is essential for any further processing, as many physiological quantities such as heart rate variability (HRV) depends on the peak-to-peak distances in the PPG signal, known as the RR Series. This paper attempts to provide a robust algorithm for peak detection in noise \& motion artefact corrupted PPG signals. The algorithm consists of steps to remove the baseline drift in the PPG signal using wavelet ﬁltering and trend removal and subsequent peak detection using autcorrelation for each pseudo-periodic segment of the signal. The validation of the method is done by comparing the PPG peaks detected by the algorithm with RR series extracted from simultaneously captured ECG signal.},

Four methods to calculate PAT from the measured signals were evaluated. PAT was calculated as the time delay between ECG R peak and one of the following points in the PPG waveform: peak (maximum value of PPG waveform), foot (minimum value of PPG waveform), dpeak (maximum value of the first derivative of PPG waveform) and ddpeak (maximum value of the second derivative of PPG waveform). In addition to PAT calculation, pulse period (PP) intervals based on the detected features were determined and compared to RR intervals derived from ECG signal. Based on the results obtained here, the most promising method to be used in PAT or PP calculation seems to be the dpeak detection method.},

	abstract = {Background: The term endurance sport (ES) is broadly used to characterize any exercise that requires maintenance of high cardiac output over extended time. However, the relative amount of isotonic (volume) versus isometric (pressure) cardiac stress varies across ES disciplines. To what degree ES-mediated cardiac remodeling varies, as a function of superimposed isometric stress, is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the cardiac remodeling characteristics associated with two common yet physiologically distinct forms of ES.
Methods: Healthy competitive male long-distance runners (high isotonic, low isometric stress; n = 40) and rowers (high isotonic, high isometric stress; n = 40) were comparatively studied after 3 months of sportspeciﬁc exercise training with conventional and speckle-tracking two-dimensional echocardiography.
Results: Rowers demonstrated dilated left ventricular (LV) volumes and elevated LV mass (i.e., eccentric LV hypertrophy), whereas runners demonstrated normal LV mass (runners, 88 6 11 g/m2; rowers, 108 6 13 g/ m2; P {\textless} .001) despite comparatively larger LV volumes (runners, 101 6 10 mL/m2; rowers, 89 6 13 mL/m2; P {\textless} .001) consistent with eccentric LV remodeling. Increasing LV mass was associated with increased reliance on early diastolic ﬁlling (LV mass vs E0/A0 ratio, R = 0.47, P {\textless} .001) indicating ‘‘mass-dependent’’ diastolic function. Right ventricular dilation of similar magnitude and LV systolic function, as assessed by numerous complementary indices, were similar in both groups.
Conclusions: Cardiac adaptations differ signiﬁcantly as a function of ES discipline. Further work is required to determine the mechanisms for this differential adaptation, to develop deﬁnitive ES discipline-speciﬁc normative values, and to evaluate the optimal therapeutic use of speciﬁc ES disciplines among patients with common cardiovascular diseases.

	abstract = {Long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), which have recently emerged in sequential data analysis, are the most widely used type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) architecture. Progress on the topic of deep learning includes successful adaptations of deep versions of these architectures. In this study, a new model for deep bidirectional LSTM network-based wavelet sequences called DBLSTM-WS was proposed for classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. For this purpose, a new wavelet-based layer is implemented to generate ECG signal sequences. The ECG signals were decomposed into frequency sub-bands at different scales in this layer. These subbands are used as sequences for the input of LSTM networks. New network models that include unidirectional (ULSTM) and bidirectional (BLSTM) structures are designed for performance comparisons. Experimental studies have been performed for ﬁve different types of heartbeats obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. These ﬁve types are Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Ventricular Premature Contraction (VPC), Paced Beat (PB), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), and Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB). The results show that the DBLSTM-WS model gives a high recognition performance of 99.39\%. It has been observed that the wavelet-based layer proposed in the study signiﬁcantly improves the recognition performance of conventional networks. This proposed network structure is an important approach that can be applied to similar signal processing problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning for active classiﬁcation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To this end, we learn a suitable feature representation from the raw ECG data in an unsupervised way using stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) with sparsity constraint. After this feature learning phase, we add a softmax regression layer on the top of the resulting hidden representation layer yielding the so-called deep neural network (DNN). During the interaction phase, we allow the expert at each iteration to label the most relevant and uncertain ECG beats in the test record, which are then used for updating the DNN weights. As ranking criteria, the method relies on the DNN posterior probabilities to associate conﬁdence measures such as entropy and Breaking-Ties (BT) to each test beat in the ECG record under analysis. In the experiments, we validate the method on the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as well as two other databases called INCART, and SVDB, respectively. Furthermore, we follow the recommendations of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) for class labeling and results presentation. The results obtained show that the newly proposed approach provides signiﬁcant accuracy improvements with less expert interaction and faster online retraining compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electric activity of the heart and has been widely used for detecting heart diseases due to its simplicity and non-invasive nature. By analyzing the electrical signal of each heartbeat, i.e., the combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac tissues found in the heart, it is possible to detect some of its abnormalities. In the last decades, several works were developed to produce automatic ECG-based heartbeat classiﬁcation methods. In this work, we survey the current state-of-the-art methods of ECG-based automated abnormalities heartbeat classiﬁcation by presenting the ECG signal preprocessing, the heartbeat segmentation techniques, the feature description methods and the learning algorithms used. In addition, we describe some of the databases used for evaluation of methods indicated by a well-known standard developed by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and described in ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998/(R)2008 (ANSI/AAMI, 2008). Finally, we discuss limitations and drawbacks of the methods in the literature presenting concluding remarks and future challenges, and also we propose an evaluation process workﬂow to guide authors in future works.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection of abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) waves is a key issue in the field of medical engineering. Many sever heart diseases show periodic abnormal waves in ECG. This provide informative suggestions for identifying the staging or abnormal site of heart disease. However, so far, few studies have tackled automatic detection of periodic abnormal ECG wave. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting periodic abnormal waves in ECG. This method is based on the deep neural network model that learns wave’s shape and their temporal relevance by combing AutoEncoder and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In the experiments, using ECG data of a myocardial infarction patient, it is shown that our method can identify adequately interval of abnormal wave, which the existing method was not able to detect.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are widely used to gauge the health of the human heart, and the resulting time series signal is often analyzed manually by a medical professional to detect any arrhythmia that the patient may have suffered. Much work has been done to automate the process of analyzing ECG signals, but most of the research involves extensive preprocessing of the ECG data to derive vectorized features and subsequently designing a classiﬁer to discriminate between healthy ECG signals and those indicative of an Arrhythmia. This approach requires knowledge and data of the different types of Arrhythmia for training. However, the heart is a complex organ and there are many different and new types of Arrhythmia that can occur which were not part of the original training set. Thus, it may be more prudent to adopt an anomaly detection approach towards analyzing ECG signals. In this paper, we utilize a deep recurrent neural network architecture with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to develop a predictive model for healthy ECG signals. We further utilize the probability distribution of the prediction errors from these recurrent models to indicate normal or abnormal behavior. An added advantage of using LSTM networks is that the ECG signal can be directly fed into the network without any elaborate preprocessing as required by other techniques. Also, no prior information about abnormal signals is needed by the networks as they were trained only on normal data. We have used the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to obtain ECG time series data for both normal periods and for periods during four different types of Arrhythmias, namely Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Paced Beats (PB) and Ventricular Couplet (VC). Results are promising and indicate that Deep LSTM models may be viable for detecting anomalies in ECG signals.},

METHODS A list of the authors who are members of the Cardiology Consensus Group of the English Football Association is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. N Engl J Med 2018;379:524-34. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1714719 From 1996 through 2016, we screened 11,168 adolescent athletes with a mean (±SD) age of 16.4±1.2 years (95\% of whom were male) in the English Football Association (FA) cardiac screening program, which consisted of a health questionnaire, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The FA registry was interrogated to identify sudden cardiac deaths, which were confirmed with autopsy reports. Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.
RESULTS During screening, 42 athletes (0.38\%) were found to have cardiac disorders that are associated with sudden cardiac death. A further 225 athletes (2\%) with congenital or valvular abnormalities were identified. After screening, there were 23 deaths from any cause, of which 8 (35\%) were sudden deaths attributed to cardiac disease. Cardiomyopathy accounted for 7 of 8 sudden cardiac deaths (88\%). Six athletes (75\%) with sudden cardiac death had had normal cardiac screening results. The mean time between screening and sudden cardiac death was 6.8 years. On the basis of a total of 118,351 person-years, the incidence of sudden cardiac death among previously screened adolescent soccer players was 1 per 14,794 person-years (6.8 per 100,000 athletes).
CONCLUSIONS Diseases that are associated with sudden cardiac death were identified in 0.38\% of adolescent soccer players in a cohort that underwent cardiovascular screening. The incidence of sudden cardiac death was 1 per 14,794 person-years, or 6.8 per 100,000 athletes; most of these deaths were due to cardiomyopathies that had not been detected on screening.

	abstract = {Objective: Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is a common type of heart rhythm abnormality caused by a problem with the heart’s electrical system. Early detection of this disease has important implications for stroke prevention and management. Our objective is to construct an intelligent tool that assists cardiologists in identifying automatically cardiac arrhythmias and noise in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Approach: Our base deep classiﬁer combined a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) and a sequence of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, with pooling, dropout and normalization techniques to improve their accuracy. The network predicted a classiﬁcation at every 18th input sample and the ﬁnal prediction was selected for classiﬁcation. Ten standalone models that used our base classiﬁer architecture were ﬁrst cross-validated separately on 90\% of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 dataset and then tested on 10\%. An ensemble classiﬁer selected the label of the best average probability from the ten sub-models to improve prediction quality. Main results: Our original result submitted to the challenge gave a mean F1-measure of 80\%. The new proposed method improved the test score to 82\% in the follow-up phase of the challenge. Signiﬁcance: Without employing a time-consuming feature engineering step, the ensemble classiﬁer trained with this architecture provided a robust solution to the problem of detecting cardiac arrhythmia from noisy ECG signals. In addition, interpretation of the classiﬁer by inspection of its network parameters and predictions revealed what aspects of the ECG signal the classiﬁer considered most discriminating.},

	abstract = {Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a non-invasive tool for assessing the hemodynamic parameters. It has been used for diagnosing several cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and valvular diseases. Particularly, the valvular heart disease is characterized by the damage in one of the four heart valves: the mitral, aortic, tricuspid or pulmonary valves. The mitral valve insufficiency and the aortic valve stenos are the most frequent valve diseases in the world. In this paper, we propose to diagnosis the mitral valve insufficiency using the impedance cardiography technique. The study group consisted of 40 subjects (20 control subjects and 20 patients with mitral insufficiency). A parameter “I” is calculated from the impedance cardiogram waveform and it is used to differentiate control subjects from patients with mitral insufficiency. The parameter “I” was related significantly to the abnormalities of the impedance cardiogram waveform. For patients with mitral insufficiency, “I” was higher than for the healthy subjects with a difference ratio of 89\% (p{\textless}0.001). To improve the diagnosis, we determined the stroke volume, cardiac output, and other hemodynamic parameters for the two groups of subjects. Finally, we concluded that we could identify, easily, patients with mitral insufficiency based on the abnormalities of the impedance cardiogram tracings and a characteristic parameter “I”.},

In some specific applications, such as body composition assessment where EBI has proven a good degree of effectiveness and reliability, the use of textile electrodes and measurement garments have shown good performance and reproducible results. Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a modality of EBI that can benefit from the implementation and use of wearable sensors. ICG is based on continuous impedance measurements of a longitudinal segment across the thorax taken at a single frequency. The need for a specific electrode placement on the thorax and neck can be easily ensured with the use of a garment with embedded textile electrodes, also known as “textrodes.” The first step towards the implementation of garment-based ICG is to determine the quality of ICG measurements with textile sensors to allow estimation of fundamental ICG parameters. In this work, the measurement performance of a 2-belt set with incorporated textrodes for thorax and neck is compared against ICG measurements obtained with Ag/AgCl electrodes. The analysis is based on the quality of the fundamental ICG signals (∆Z, dZ/dt and ECG), systolic time intervals and other ICG parameters. The results indicate the feasibility of using textrodes for ICG measurements with consistent measurements and relatively low data dispersion. Thus, enabling the development of measuring garments for ICG measurements.},

This paper introduces a method using ISTI to evaluate and predict the circulatory response to fluid administration in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and presents preliminary results of a pilot study by comparing ISTI with cardiac output (CO) responsiveness. Also the use of the pulse transit time (PTT), earlier recommended for this purpose, was investigated. The results showed an inverse relationship between ISTI and CO at all moments of fluid administration and also an inverse relationship between the changes ΔISTI and ΔCO before and after full fluid administration. No relationships between PTT and CO or ΔPTT and ΔCO were found.

However, the duration of the ISTI has not yet been compared to other time markers of the heart cycle. The present study gauges the duration of the ISTI by comparing the end point of this interval, the Cpoint, with heart cycle markers obtained by echocardiography. The heart rate of 16 healthy subjects was varied by means of an exercise stimulus. It was found that the C-point, and therefore the end point of ISTI, occurred around the moment of the maximum diameter of the aortic arch in all subjects and at all heart rates. However, while the time difference between the opening of the aortic valves and the maximum diameter of the aortic arch decreased significantly with decreasing RR-interval, the time difference with respect to the moment of the C-point remained constant within the subjects. This means that the shortening of the ISTI with increasing heart rate in response to an exercise stimulus was caused by a shortening of the pre-ejection period (PEP). It is concluded that the ISTI can be used as a non-invasive parameter indicating the time difference between the electrical and mechanical pumping activity of the heart, both inside and outside the clinic.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A key aim of triage is to identify those with high risk of cardiac arrest, as they require intensive monitoring, resuscitation facilities, and early intervention. We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS).
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death.
Results: From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95\% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95\% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score ≥ 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1\%, specificity of 72.3\% and negative predictive value of 98.8\%. A cutoff MEWS ≥ 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4\%, specificity of 54.2\% and negative predictive value of 97.8\%.
Conclusion: We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction.},

	abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in athletes during sport. Whether obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes, an ECG increases the ability to detect underlying cardiovascular conditions that may increase the risk for SCD. In most countries, there is a shortage of physician expertise in the interpretation of an athlete’s ECG. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from abnormal ﬁndings suggestive of pathology. On 13–14 February 2012, an international group of experts in sports cardiology and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington, to deﬁne contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to develop a comprehensive training resource to help physicians distinguish normal ECG alterations in athletes from abnormal ECG ﬁndings that require additional evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.},

	abstract = {Many sporting organisations recommend a preparticipation ECG to screen for disorders which predispose to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The ability of the ECG to perform accurately is dependent on the ECG criteria used and the experience of the operator. There have been several ECG criteria over the last decade, though these were recently superseded with the publication of the ’International Consensus Criteria for ECG Interpretation in Athletes’. These criteria use the latest evidence to improve specificity while maintaining sensitivity for ECG-detectable pathologies associated with SCA. Accordingly, this review describes the normal, borderline and abnormal ECG findings in an asymptomatic athlete aged 12–35 years.},
